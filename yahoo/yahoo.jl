The organizers of Boston's embattled St. Patrick's Day parade have scheduled an emergency meeting to reconsider their vote to shut out the gay veterans group. This week's decision to bar OutVets from marching drew immediate condemnation from high-profile politicians and stirred up a furor on social media. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) More BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Organizers of the city's St. Patrick's Day parade reversed course on Friday and said they would allow a group of gay veterans to march in this year's parade. The South Boston Allied War Veterans Council announced on the parade's Twitter account that it had signed an \"acceptance letter\" that would clear the way for OutVets to participate. OutVets did not immediately say whether it would accept the invitation to march. \"We are in receipt of a letter from the allied war council, and we are actively reviewing it,\" said Dee Dee Edmondson, a lawyer for the group. An earlier vote by the council to bar OutVets from marching drew immediate condemnation from high-profile politicians, some of whom said they would not march if the gay veterans were excluded. It caused some sponsors to back out and stirred up a furor on social media. It was unclear if the reversal of the decision was a result of a second vote by the council. \"I decided this is a wrong that has to be corrected,\" the parade's lead organizer, Tim Duross, told WHDH-TV. Earlier Friday, OutVets executive director Bryan Bishop said the vets had been told the original decision to bar them was because of their rainbow symbols. Bishop said the council offered to allow the group to march if its members did not display the rainbow flag, a symbol of gay pride, which is on their banner and their jackets. The group said no. \"I almost fell out of the chair at that point, said, 'You gotta be kidding me,'\" Bishop said. He said OutVets has displayed the rainbow at the parade the last two years. \"It infuriates me to look at the veterans that I know, gay and straight, who have served this country with valor and honor and distinction, and just because you're a veteran who happens to be gay your service is somehow less than someone who is not of the LGBT community or someone who's not gay,\" he said. Edmondson, the OutVets lawyer, described the letter as \"generic\" and said it did not make fully clear whether the gay group would be allowed to display its banner. Another veterans group, Veterans for Peace, said it also had been denied permission to participate. That group has been trying unsuccessfully for several years to march. OutVets was first allowed to participate in the parade in 2015, in what was seen as a groundbreaking decision after parade organizers had, for decades, resisted the inclusion of gay groups. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1995 upheld the council's right to bar gay groups on free speech grounds. The council said in a statement Thursday its decision had been misinterpreted. \"The council is accepting of all people and organizations, but it will not permit messages that conflict with the overall theme of the parade,\" the statement said. That decision resulted in backlash from other veterans' organizations. The council is made up of representatives from several South Boston American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts. The Michael J. Perkins American Legion Post said it had withdrawn from the council. The Perkins post in a statement on its Facebook page didn't mention the OutVets decision but said it decided to withdraw because \"recent efforts by several non-veteran parade volunteers to guide decision making has resulted in the subversion of the council as an organization being led by veterans.\" Another former member of the council, the Thomas J. Fitzgerald VFW Post, assailed the council's decision to bar OutVets. The Fitzgerald post withdrew from the council last year over the decision to bar Veterans for Peace.

The lack of Catholic priests is an \u201cenormous problem,\u201d Francis recently said, suggesting he would be open to allowing married men to be ordained as priests.     Tony Gentile/Reuters      There are already ordained married priests in the church. In 1980, Pope John Paul II decided to allow married men to become priests in limited circumstances, such as\u00a0married former clergymen from the Episcopal Church. Francis, 80, the first Jesuit and Latin American pontiff, took over the papacy from Pope Benedict XVI in March 2013. Since then, religious followers around the globe have viewed him as a progressive leader. His reign has meant a more inclusive and forgiving Roman Catholic Church\u00a0and has rhetorically broken with religious tradition in several cases, including allowing not just bishops but also priests\u00a0 to forgive abortion \u00a0and saying that the church could be more open to same-sex unions. Just last month, he suggested it\u2019s better to be an atheist than a hypocritical Catholic, meaning those whom he described   as living a \u201cdouble life\u201d  and starting scandals. Men and women in the Catholic Church serve different roles; only men can be ordained. In his   1994 apostolic letter , Pope John Paul II claimed that \u201cthe Church has no authority whatsoever\u201d to ordain women as priests; Jesus chose only men to serve as his 12 apostles. For decades, women have requested larger leadership positions within the church. While meeting with hundreds of leaders last spring, Francis indicated that he was\u00a0open to discussion about the possibility of ordaining women as deacons. Three months later, he went on to create\u00a0a commission to study the role of women deacons in the early church, namely Phoebe, who appears to be mentioned as a minister in the Bible.\u00a0A similar commission was formed in 2002 among high-level officials at the Vatican, and the panel produced a document that considered whether women might be eligible to become deacons. The members didn\u2019t reach a firm conclusion. Jeopardy\u00a0 has taken note. On Thursday, the Final Jeopardy question on the\u00a0game show asked, In which country, according to a 2011 report, does the citizenry include\u00a0a total of 32 women? The answer was the Vatican.

Gen. Joseph Votel, who heads U.S. Central Command, said he sees no need for additional investigations into the January mission that triggered debate in Washington over what went wrong and whether important intelligence was actually gathered. It was the first military raid authorized by President Donald Trump. Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee that a separate investigation into potential civilian casualties found that between four and 12 innocent people were killed. During the raid on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula militants, U.S. special operations forces came under heavy fire. Chief Special Warfare Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens was killed, six other American service members were injured and a helicopter was damaged. Among the civilians killed was the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and U.S. citizen who was targeted and killed by a drone strike in 2011. Votel, who presided over an internal review, said he was \"looking for information gaps where we can't explain what happened in a particular situation or we have conflicting information between members of the organization. I am looking for indicators of incompetence or poor decision making or bad judgment throughout all this.\" In the end, he said, \"I was satisfied that none of those indicators that I identified to you were present. I think we had a good understanding of exactly what happened on this objective and we've been able to pull lessons learned out of that, that we will apply in future operations.\" He said there was no need for an additional investigation. Votel added that he believes the U.S. gained valuable information on al-Qaida militants. Trump, who honored Owens' widow during his speech to Congress last week, has repeatedly defended the raid as highly successful. He told Congress that it \"generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" Votel said investigations into the helicopter crash are continuing. One is an aircraft safety investigation, intended to generate any important information for the helicopter fleet. The second is a look at what caused the helicopter to make a hard landing.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The top U.S. commander for the Middle East told senators Thursday that he has completed an exhaustive review of the Yemen raid that killed a Navy SEAL, and has concluded there were no lapses in judgment or decision-making surrounding the operation.", "title": "General says no bad decisions in Yemen raid, probe is over"}

The practice of sharing such photos goes beyond the Marine Corps and one Facebook group. Hundreds of nude photos of female service members from every military branch have been posted to an image-sharing message board that dates back to at least May. A source informed Business Insider of the site's existence on Tuesday. The site, called AnonIB, has a dedicated board for military personnel that features dozens of threaded conversations among men, many of whom ask for \"wins\" \u2014 naked photographs \u2014 of specific female service members, often identifying the women by name or where they are stationed. The revelation comes on the heels of an explosive story published on Saturday by the  journalist Thomas Brennan . He reported on a Facebook group called Marines United, which was home to approximately 30,000 members who were sharing nude photos of colleagues along with personal information and even encouragement of sexual assault. The report led the Marine Corps to open an investigation, spurred widespread outrage in the media and in Congress, and  prompted sharp condemnation  from the Corps' top leaders. According to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, investigators  are considering felony charges  that could carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. An official familiar with the matter told Business Insider that the Marine commandant, Gen. Robert Neller, would brief members of the House Armed Services Committee next week on the scandal. \"We're examining some of our policies to see if we can make them punitive in nature,\" the official said, adding that the Corps was taking the issue very seriously. A Facebook-group exodus leads to a message board's popularity View photos marine general neller More (Gen. Robert Neller, commandant of the Marine Corps. He is expected to brief Congress next week on the scandal.US Marine Corps/Cpl. Shawn Valosin)  Brennan's story also led to an apparent exodus of members from the private Facebook group, though some appeared to have found the publicly viewable message board soon after \u2014 with the express intent of finding the cache of nude images that Marines in the Facebook group were sharing. \"Come on Marines share the wealth here before that site is nuked and all is lost,\" one anonymous user said in a post on Monday, two days after Brennan's story was published. Follow-up replies offered a link to a Dropbox folder named \"Girls of MU\" with thousands of photographs. Dropbox did not respond to a request for comment. Members on the board often posted photos \u2014 seemingly stolen from female service members' Instagram accounts \u2014 before asking others if they had nude pictures of a female service member. For example, after posting the first name and photograph of a female soldier in uniform on January 21, one board member asked for \"Army chick went to [redacted], ig is [redacted].\" Another user, apparently frustrated that no pictures had yet been found, posted a few days later: \"BUMP. Let's see them t------.\" On another thread, a member posted a photograph on May 30 of a female service member with her breasts exposed and said, \"She is in the navy down in san diego, anyone have any more wins?\" View photos us navy guam More (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Sean M. Castellano)  One user followed up on June 13, offering another nude photo of the woman. \"Keep them coming! She's got them floating around someone [sic] and I've wanted to see this for a while,\" another user wrote in response. Some requested nude photographs by unit or location. One user asked in September for photos of women in the Massachusetts National Guard, while another requested some from the Guard in Michigan. Other requests included nude pictures of any women stationed at Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas, or Naval Medical Center in San Diego, along with many more US military installations around the world. In statements to Business Insider, military branches denounced the message board and promised discipline for any service members who engaged in misconduct. \"This alleged behavior is inconsistent with our values,\" Lt. Col. Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, told Business Insider. Capt. Ryan Alvis, a spokeswoman for the Marine Corps, told Business Insider that the service expects the discovery of the Marines United page will motivate others to come forward to report other pages like it. \"Marines will attack this problem head-on and continue to get better,\" Alvis said.

Jennifer Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Army, told Business Insider: \"The Army is a values-based organization where everyone is expected to be treated with dignity and respect. As members of the Army team, individuals' interaction offline and online reflect on the Army and its values. Soldiers or civilian employees who participate in or condone misconduct, whether offline or online, may be subject to criminal, disciplinary, and/or administrative action.\" Air Force spokesman Zachary Anderson told Business Insider: \"We expect our Airmen to adhere to these values at all times and to treat their fellow service members with the highest degree of dignity and respect. Any conduct or participation in activities, whether online or offline, that does not adhere to these principles will not be tolerated. Airmen or civilian employees who engage in activities of misconduct that demean or disrespect fellow service members will be appropriately disciplined.\" The Navy did not respond to a request for comment. 'Hope we can find more on this gem' The image board hosts disturbing conversations that in many cases appear to be between active-duty personnel. \"Any wins of [redacted]?\" read one request, which shared further details about a female Marine's whereabouts, indicating the user likely worked with her in the past. Another thread, posted in November, that had dozens of follow-up comments from users acting as cyber-sleuths to track down the victim started with a single photograph of a female Marine, fully clothed, taken from her Instagram account. \"Any wins?\" that user asked, telling others the Marine's first name and where she had been stationed. One user hinted at her last name as others scoured her Instagram account, posting more photos they had found. One photo of the victim and her friend prompted one user to ask for nude photos of the friend as well: \"Any of the dark haired girl in the green shirt and jeans next to her?\" View photos American soldiers are seen at the U.S. army base in Qayyara, south of Mosul REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani More (Thomson Reuters)  The thread carried on for months. \"Amazing thread,\" one user wrote. \"Hope we can find more on this gem.\" In December, a nude photo was finally posted. \"Dudeee more,\" one user wrote in response. Many others responded by \"bumping\" the thread to the top so that others on the board would see it and potentially post more photos. Indeed, more photos soon appeared from the victim's Instagram account, which was apparently made private or shut down numerous times. On the board, users complained that her Instagram account kept disappearing, apparently because she was trying to thwart her harassers. But others quickly found her new accounts and told others, and the new Instagram account names were shared throughout February. \"Oh god please someone have that p----,\" one user wrote. View photos blurred1 More (Screenshot)  The site that hosts the message board seems to have little moderation and few rules, though it tells users \"Don't be evil.\" Its rules instruct members to not post personal details such as addresses, telephone numbers, links to social networks, or last names. Still, many users on the board do not appear to follow those rules. In one popular thread, started on January 9, an anonymous user posted non-nude pictures of a female airman, telling others in the caption: \"Anyone know her or have anything else on her? I've got a lot more if there is interest. Would love for her friends and family to see these.\" The user, who suggested in the accompanying captions that he was a jilted ex-boyfriend, posted many more photos in the hours and days after. \"She knows how to end it all. If she does get in contact with me I won't post anymore. So get it while it's hot!\" he wrote. Later in the thread, the man even referred to the airman by name and told her to check her Instagram messages. View photos air force More (AP/John L. Mone)  \"Wow, she blocked me on Instagram!\" he later wrote. \"Stupid c--- must want me to post her s--- up. I gave her a choice, it didn't have to be this way. I'm not a bad guy, she had a choice. Oh well, no point in holding back now. I want you all to share this everywhere you can, once I start seeing her more places I'll post her video.\" Aside from those on active duty, some users who identified themselves as cadets at some military service academies started threads to try to find nude photos of their female classmates. In a thread dedicated to the US Military Academy at West Point, some users who appeared to be cadets shared photos and graduation years of their female classmates. \"What about the basketball locker room pics, I know someone has those,\" one user said, apparently referring to photos taken surreptitiously in a women's locker room. \"I always wondered whether those made it out of the academy computer system,\" another user responded. In 2012, an Army sergeant who helped train and mentor cadets was discovered to have secretly filmed more than a dozen women  in the bathroom and shower areas  at West Point. The soldier  pleaded guilty in the case  and was sentenced in 2014 to 33 months in prison. View photos marines More (US Marine Corps photo)  \"Bumping all 3 service academies' threads to see who can post the best wins in the next 7 days. Winning school gets the [commander's cup],\" one user wrote. \"Go Army, Beat Everyone.\" Lt. Col. Christopher Kasker, a spokesman for the US Military Academy, told Business Insider:\u00a0\"The content on this image board or other websites, attributed to both West Point graduates and our fellow service members, is both alarming and contrary to our values. When alerted to incidents such as this, we thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action.\" 'This has to be treated harshly' The existence of a site dedicated solely to sharing nude photographs of female service members is another black mark for the Pentagon, which has been criticized in the past for failing to deal with rampant sexual harassment and abuse within the ranks. A 2014 Rand Corporation  study estimated  that more than 20,000 service members had been sexually assaulted in the previous year. Nearly six times as many reported being sexually harassed. In some cases, the military has pushed out  victims of sexual assault who reported it , instead of the perpetrators. \"I'm kind of surprised. I'm still naive, I think, on some level,\" said Kate Hendricks Thomas, a former Marine Corps officer who is now an assistant professor at Charleston Southern University. \"I am really disappointed to hear that the reach is broader than 30,000 and a couple of now-defunct websites.\" Thomas criticized past responses to the problem, in which some had indicated the issue was too difficult for the military to wrap its arms around. \"This renders us less mission-effective. It's got to be a priority,\" she said. \"These websites are not boys being boys,\" she added. \"This is a symptom of rape culture.\" The message board also presents a challenge for military leaders, who may face an uphill battle in trying to find \u2014 and potentially prosecute \u2014 active-duty service members who shared photos on the site. Unlike the Marines United Facebook group, where many users posted under their real names, the message board's user base is mostly anonymous, and the site itself is registered in the Bahamas, outside the jurisdiction of US law enforcement. Brad Moss, a lawyer who specializes in national-security issues, told Business Insider that the military may have a hard time persuading the internet service provider to shut down the website. Instead, he said, the victims themselves may have more legal standing if they were to contact the ISP to remove the photos. Still, Moss said he believes the military could squash the behavior if it adopted a \"zero-tolerance\" posture. \"I think that absolutely, 100%, should be the policy if they catch the main perpetrators who are sharing these photos around and essentially engaging in revenge porn,\" Moss said. \"They should have a zero-tolerance policy and boot them from the military with a dishonorable discharge. \"If they do anything less, it's only going to incentivize this behavior in the future,\" he added. \"This has to be treated harshly.\" This article was updated on 3/10 at 6:40 a.m. PDT to add a statement from the US Military Academy.

For a long time, she followed dieting tips she found on websites promoting anorexia, which led to a self-destructive mindset and restrictive eating habits. In recent years, things have gotten much better: Inspired by a quote she picked up from body positivity advocate  Megan Crabbe  (@bodyposipanda) - \"You will never hate yourself into loving yourself\u201d - Martina felt empowered to give herself a break and simply accept her body for what it is. It's an approach that's helping her become more comfortable in her skin and learn to love her body. As an artist majoring in sculpture, and conflict analysis and dispute resolution, Martina likes finding ways to reflect her own personal journey through art. So she decided to create a live performance project titled \u201cThe Hidden Secret of Eating Disorders,\u201d timed to correspond with  National Eating Disorders Awareness Week . \"I wanted to create a sculpture that depicted the darkness and entrapment of a negative body image, self-hate, and eating disorders,\" she explains. So Martina constructed a standing closet large enough to fit one person. Inside, she burned the message, \"Welcome,\" signed by \"Ana,\" on a doormat to represent anorexia. She covered the rest of the floor with scales covered with the words that go through many people's minds when they're silently suffering from disordered eating. View photos Photo credit: Lilly Metcalfe More The structure's walls are made from black plastic with a dual meaning: The material represents the trashcan some sufferers use to purge, and at the same time, a body bag for those who die from striving to reach unrealistic standards of beauty. There are also broken mirrors to represent feelings of insufficiency and insecurity. Martina parked the sculpture on campus, then asked people to enter the closet, one at a time, and reflect on these issues by writing on the walls. At the same time, she wanted to project body positivity and raise awareness with a statement of self-love  outside  the closet. To illustrate her vulnerability, she decided to wear a nude body suit in public - a big deal, since she doesn't typically skip around campus in her skivvies, and even tends to avoid swimming pools to sidestep the whole swimsuit thing. It's one reason she mentally freaked out once her clothes came off: \"The second that I pulled down my pants [outside], all I could think in my head was, 'I am actually doing this. I am actually doing this.'\" View photos Photo credit: Courtesy of Martina Maya-Callen More On her body, she used a black marker to write out the negative thoughts that have long plagued her and are often internalized, like \"not enough,\" and \"ugly.\" Then, she invited the public to write whatever they wanted onto her body. After posting photos of her project online, Martina received some threatening comments from people who insist eating disorders don't exist or that she's \"fat.\" \"[Negative feedback] makes me realize just how needed this project is to spread awareness for eating disorders and these issues because people are uneducated,\" Martina says. In sum, the response to her public art performance suggests it was a great success: One photo she posted on Instagram was liked by more than 26,000 people - a lot, considering she has just over 5,000 followers. She's also heard from many people who've been inspired by her message. \"After this project, I feel more confident in my body and am truly further in my journey of self-love,\" she says. \"[But] it's [also] about all the other people who look in the mirror and feel like they are not good enough,\" she says. \"[I'm] unbelievably happy that I could be a catalyst to people\u2019s journey of self-love.\" Martina raising money to take her project on the road through selling body-positive and eating disorder awareness T-shirts, which you can purchase by contacting her via her  website .

Sessions is seeking the resignations of 46 United States attorneys who were appointed during the prior presidential administration, the Justice Department said Friday, March 10, 2017. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) More WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions is seeking the resignations of 46 United States attorneys who were appointed during prior presidential administrations, the Justice Department said Friday. Many of the federal prosecutors who were nominated by former President Barack Obama have already left their positions, but the nearly four dozen who stayed on in the first weeks of the Trump administration have been asked to leave \"in order to ensure a uniform transition,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said. \"Until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. attorney's offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting and deterring the most violent offenders,\" she said in a statement. By Friday evening, U.S. attorneys around the country \u2014 including New Jersey, Rhode Island, Minnesota and Montana \u2014 had publicly announced their resignations. It's fairly customary for the 93 U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, but the departures are not automatic and don't necessarily happen all at once. One U.S. attorney appointed by President George W. Bush, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, remained on the job for the entire Obama administration and is the current nominee for deputy attorney general in the Trump administration. A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, said late Friday that President Donald Trump has asked Rosenstein and Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, who has served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to stay on. For more  news videos  visit  Yahoo View , available now on  iOS  and  Android . The action was similar to one taken in 1993 by then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who soon after taking office sought the resignations of the U.S. attorneys appointed by President George H.W. Bush. At the time, Sessions was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. Tim Purdon, a former U.S. attorney for North Dakota in the Obama administration, recalled that President Barack Obama permitted Bush appointees to remain on until their successors had been appointed and confirmed. \"The way the Obama administration handled it was appropriate and respectful and classy,\" Purdon said. \"This saddens me because many of these people are great public servants and now they are being asked to leave.\" U.S. attorneys are federal prosecutors who are nominated by the president, generally upon the recommendation of a home-state senator, and are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes in the territories they oversee. They report to Justice Department leadership in Washington, and their priorities are expected to be in line with those of the attorney general. Sessions took perhaps a veiled swipe at their work in a memo earlier this week, saying that prosecutions for violent crime have been on the decline even as the number of murders has gone up. The demand for resignations seems a way to ensure he will have a team of new federal prosecutors more likely to share his agenda. Friday's announcement came months after Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan and one of the most prominent federal prosecutors, said he'd been asked by Trump to stay on and that he intended to. Bharara's office declined to comment Friday. Montana's U.S. Attorney Mike Cotter said he received a phone call from Boente telling him \"the president has directed this.\" \"I think it's very unprofessional and I'm very disappointed,\" he said. \"What happened today on Friday, March 10, that was so important that all Obama appointees who are U.S. attorneys need to be gone?\" \"I gotta write that (resignation) letter. It's going to be a one-liner,\" he added. ____ Associated Press writer Matt Volz in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to show that it's fairly customary for the 93 U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, not that it's not customary.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions is seeking the resignations of 46 United States attorneys who were appointed during prior presidential administrations, the Justice Department said Friday.", "title": "Attorney general seeks resignations of 46 US attorneys"}

Such unimpressive performance results in you throwing money down the drain.\u00a0 To help you steer clear of laundry products that don't work as promised, here's a list of the worst laundry products from our tests\u2014they scored 40 or lower overall out of 100.\u00a0 Washing Machines These washers earned only a fair score overall, with a score of 39 or lower in our tests. And while some of the prices are appealing, there are better choices in our  washing machine ratings , often for the same price. Front-Loading Washing Machines   The bottom-rated  Electrolux EFLW417SlW , $600, did a superb job cleaning but was tough on fabrics and didn't extract as much water as the others\u2014that means the dryer runs longer to dry the load. High-Efficiency Top-Loading Washers\u00a0   The  Frigidaire Affinity FAHE4045QW , $720, was very good at cleaning, and the\u00a0 Affinity FAHE1011MW , $700, did an excellent job. But they used about twice as much water as the most efficient HE top-loaders and didn't extract much of that water, and were rougher on fabrics than most. The\u00a0 Samsung WA40J3000AW , $380, \u00a0 is the least expensive HE top-loader in our tests but\u00a0used even more water than the Frigidaire washers and still left a lot of stains on fabrics, putting it at the bottom of the  HE top-loader ratings .\u00a0 Agitator Top-Loading Washers\u00a0   Agitator washers usually cost $500 or less, including the top-rated  Kenmore 22242 , $480. The worst from our tests left many of the stains on our test fabrics, while using more water than a number of the other agitator machines\u2014helping to put the\u00a0 Whirlpool WTW4816FW ,\u00a0$450;\u00a0 Amana NTW4516FW ,\u00a0$300; and\u00a0 Roper RTW4516FW , $275, at the bottom of the\u00a0 agitator washer ratings .\u00a0 Clothes Dryers Any dryer will get the job done, eventually. But a money-wasting dryer might take longer, use higher heat, or overdry laundry when you want clothes a bit damp. All of this is harder on fabrics and uses more energy. Among electric dryers, the\u00a0 Frigidaire Affinity FARE1011MW , $630; the\u00a0 Hotpoint HTDP120EDWW , $450; and\u00a0the\u00a0 GE GTDX180EDWW , $450, were the worst at drying, scoring 32 or lower in our tests. (Based on decades of testing, we've determined that gas versions of dryers perform similarly to electric models; we expect the related gas models in our ratings to do just as poorly.) Laundry Detergents With laundry detergents, you can waste money in a couple of ways. Detergents that don't clean well might require you to redo a load. And, if you don't measure the detergent beforehand, you might end up using more than you need. Scoring 40 or less in our tests, these detergents were no match for common stains from body oil, dirt, and grass.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse More ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government proposed on Friday making non-EU foreigners sell their homes when they leave the country, prompting resistance from the real estate sector. More than three decades after Switzerland liberalized property purchases for foreigners, and amid concern that foreign demand helps drive up prices, the cabinet said it was time to update the law to close loopholes and improve enforcement. It suggested requiring citizens from countries outside the European Union plus Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway to get permission to buy main residences in Switzerland. \"Permits should always be linked to the duty to sell the home again as soon as residence in Switzerland is relinquished,\" the government said, as it opened a period of public comment before sending draft legislation to parliament. It also proposed tightening rules covering other types of property investment by foreigners. A real-estate lobbying group called Lex Koller Remains Modern, a reference to the original law that opened the property market to foreigners, blasted the proposals as a \"nonsensical tightening\" of the rules. These measures, if adopted, \"would pose unacceptable disadvantages for property owners while exacerbating the situation on housing markets\" it said in a statement, adding that parliament had already opposed similar changes in 2014. The lobbying group said foreigners were not to blame for overly expensive or scarce residential housing. Rising demand in an increasingly prosperous society with smaller households and more immigrants was to blame for driving rental prices higher, it said. A study by Credit Suisse this month concluded that rental prices are actually falling amid strong construction investment driven by negative Swiss interest rates. Prices of owner-occupied housing are no longer rising after a 14-year period of price growth ended late last year, the bank said.

On a mission to rehabilitate its image, Turkey is instead inching closer to being an outcast among Western nations that seem to understand their NATO ally less and less each day. (Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Press Service, Pool Photo via AP, File) More ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 On a mission to rehabilitate its image, Turkey is instead inching closer to being an outcast among Western nations that seem to understand their NATO ally less and less each day. Eight months after a failed coup shattered its delicate status quo, Turkey is mounting a concerted but thus far futile campaign to convince the outside world that the horrors of that day justify both its post-coup crackdown and a referendum on strengthening presidential powers. So too has Turkey been unable to convince the U.S. that the shadowy, exiled cleric it blames for the coup attempt is culpable and must be extradited. Squeezed between Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has sought to project an image of a modern democracy that serves as a bulwark against the extremism menacing so many of its Mideast neighbors. Yet a series of self-defeating steps are telling reminders of how wide a gulf still separates Turkey from the Western world. \"I'm not saying that we're perfect. We're not. I'm not saying that mistakes aren't being made,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek. But he said the outside world must \"at least try to understand the traumatic experience that Turkey has been going through.\" This week, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seemed to stoke tensions further when he accused Germany of \"Nazi practices\" after Turkish leaders had been prevented from rallying expats in several Germany cities in support of the referendum. Many in Europe worry that Erdogan is capitalizing on post-coup fears to push through a more authoritarian system with few checks on his power. For the West, there are real risks if Turkey feels estranged and mistreated. The country is pivotal to resolving the unrelenting civil war in neighboring Syria, where Turkey and the U.S. are at a logjam over Turkey's distrust of the Syrian Kurdish fighters the U.S. is relying on to fight the Islamic State group. And though Turkey's bid to join the European Union has lost momentum, Turkey holds major leverage by way of its deal with the EU to stem the flow of refugees into Europe, which Turkey has threatened to scuttle. Turkey's inability to make its case to the West effectively was displayed this week in the capital, Ankara, whose mayor invited a group of American journalists to interview Erdogan and other top officials, including Turkey's foreign minister, intelligence chief and military commander. After flying to Turkey, the journalists discovered there were no interviews arranged with those officials. Instead, they spoke with other officials, including the mayor, Melih Gokcek, a member of Erdogan's party. He screened graphic videos aiming to reinforce how traumatic the coup attempt had been. Then he offered unfounded conspiracy theories that the U.S. created the Islamic State group and that the U.S. and Israel colluded to artificially trigger an earthquake in Turkey so they could capture energy from the fault line. Underlying Turkey's strategy to explain itself to the West is an apparent belief that its case is most convincing when couched in bedrock Western principles, regardless of whether the appeals to those principles seem credible. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag, who also met with the visiting group, claimed no journalists in Turkey are in prison for doing journalism, even though scores have been arrested. Since the failed coup, at least 100 news outlets have been forcibly closed in a clampdown Human Rights Watch says has \"all but silenced independent media.\" Yet Bozdag insisted any journalists in prison were there for drugs, trespassing or for \"propagandizing for terrorist organizations.\" Turkish leaders have expressed exasperation that they are lambasted for the steps they took after the coup while France gets a \"pass\" for the state of emergency imposed after the 2015 Paris attacks. But France \u2014 unlike Turkey \u2014 didn't arrest 41,000 people and purge 100,000 from its civil service. Likewise, Turkey has sought to appeal to Americans' own experiences with terrorism by repeatedly comparing 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden to Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric Turkey says plotted the coup. Gulen, living in exile in Pennsylvania, denies involvement. Although Turkey says it has provided roughly a half million pieces of evidence to support its extradition request, the U.S. remains unconvinced. What little evidence Turkey has made public has been mostly anecdotes about arrested military members confessing loyalty to Gulen's movement. Aykan Erdemir, a former member of Turkey's parliament, said there are frequent and ineffective efforts taking place in Western cities and in Turkey to burnish Turkey's image, often comprising poorly planned presentations alleging Gulen's guilt. But Erdermir said the West isn't the only intended audience. Because Erdogan's Justice and Development Party once had close ties to Gulen's group, the party's leaders are vulnerable to being implicated if the post-coup crackdown moves higher up the power structure, Erdemir said. \"A lot of people are trying to prove to Erdogan they are holier than thou, that they are fighting the anti-Gulen crusade at least as enthusiastically,\" said Erdemir, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"One of the best defenses is doing such stunts. It really is a paranoid moment in Turkish political history.\" ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP", "description": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 On a mission to rehabilitate its image, Turkey is instead inching closer to being an outcast among Western nations that seem to understand their NATO ally less and less each day.", "title": "With flair but scant success, Turkey aims to repair image"}

In an interview with CNBC, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the Trump administration will make an announcement on fuel efficiency standards for cars \"very soon,\" stressing that he and President Donald Trump believe current standards were rushed through. Pruitt, 48, is a climate change denier who sued the agency he now leads more than a dozen times as Oklahoma's attorney general. He said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal is the main cause of climate change, a conclusion widely embraced by scientists. \"I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,\" he told CNBC. \"So no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,\" Pruitt said. \"But we don\u2019t know that yet, we need to continue to debate, continue the review and analysis.\u201d Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back environmental regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, including those aimed at combating climate change. He framed his stand as aimed at boosting U.S. businesses, including the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries. \"We can be pro-growth, pro-jobs and pro-environment,\" Pruitt said Wednesday afternoon in a Houston speech at CERAWeek, the world's largest gathering of energy executives. Scientists immediately criticized Pruitt's statement, saying it ignores a large body of evidence collected over decades that shows fossil fuel burning as the main factor in climate change. \"We can\u2019t afford to reject this clear and compelling scientific evidence when we make public policy. Embracing ignorance is not an option,\" Ben Santer, climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said in a statement. The Supreme Court unleashed a fury of regulation and litigation when it ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Two years later, the EPA declared carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping gases to be pollutants. Pruitt said the Supreme Court's decision should not have been viewed as permission for the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. \"Decisions were made at the executive branch level that didn't respect the rule of law,\" Pruitt said in his Houston speech. REGULATING CO2 Pruitt has previously said the EPA should not regulate CO2 without a law passed by Congress authorizing it to do so. The Republican-controlled Congress could potentially issue a strong signal to the EPA that carbon dioxide should not be regulated by the agency, a move that would undermine many Obama-era rules aimed at curbing emissions. \"Administrator Pruitt is correct, the Congress has never explicitly given the EPA the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the committee has no plans to do so,\" said Mike Danylak, spokesman for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the panel that oversees the EPA. When asked at his confirmation hearing in January whether he would uphold the EPA endangerment finding, Pruitt said it was the \"law of the land\" and he was obliged to uphold it for now. Pruitt declined to respond to a question from a reporter after his Houston speech on whether he would now seek to overturn the endangerment finding. As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Pruitt and another dozen attorney generals unsuccessfully challenged the endangerment finding in a federal appeals court. \"The mask is off. After obscuring his true views during his Senate confirmation hearings, Scott Pruitt has outed himself as a pure climate denier,\" said David Doniger, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The new EPA chief said he was committed to ensuring thorough processes for environmental rules and regulations to reduce \"regulatory uncertainty.\" Pruitt added that he shared Trump's view that the global climate accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015 was a \"bad deal.\" Trump promised during his campaign for the White House to pull the United States out of the accord, but has since been mostly quiet on the issue.

This is especially true for people who have switched from a traditional agitator top-loader to a high-efficiency top-loader. Some are so concerned that they add more water to the machine with a bucket or garden hose.\u00a0    That's a really bad idea. In fact, adding too much water can result in dingier clothes. \"Cleaning may worsen because the clothes aren\u2019t rubbing against each other in all that water\u2014it's not what the machine\u2019s design intended,\" says Emilio Gonzalez, the engineer who runs Consumer Reports' laundry appliance tests.    In recent years, as federal standards have become increasingly tough, washers are using less water and energy. An agitator top-loader that we tested 20 years ago might have used more than 40 gallons of water to wash an average load. Today\u2019s agitator machines use considerably less, and HE top-loaders and front-loaders use far less than that.    You'll know your washer is using too little water if the cottons come out dirty, or are nearly dry straight out of the washer. \"The only time we saw a model use extremely low levels of water, less than 2 gallons, our laundry came out dirty,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe figured out that that  LG front-loader  had a software problem, which the manufacturer fixed.\"    To compare the water use of one type of washer to another, we went into our labs recently and ran tests using an 8-pound load, using the normal-wash heavy-soil setting. Here are the results. Agitator Top-Loader (19 Gallons) Some agitator top-loaders still submerge dirty loads in water, with the least water efficient in our ratings using about 25 to 26 gallons to wash an average load. The  Maytag MVWB765FW , $800, scored a Good in cleaning, and a Good in our water-efficiency tests, using 19 gallons to wash our load. That's typical for other agitator washers with an automatic load-sensing feature. It adds the right amount of water based on the weight of the load. View photos  \u00a0 High-Efficiency Top-Loader (13 Gallons) The\u00a0 Whirlpool WTW8700EC \u00a0HE top-loader, $1,200, used 13 gallons to wash our load. It scored an Excellent in our water-efficiency tests and a Very Good in cleaning. HE top-loaders, which don't have an agitator, typically use 12 to 17 gallons of water in our tests. What do the results look like? \"In many models the laundry is washed in a shallow pool of water. In some models, the water level is so low you may never even see a pool of water,\" says the\u00a0 American Cleaning Institute . \u00a0 View photos  \u00a0 Front-Loader (7 Gallons) As a group, front-loaders are the most water-efficient washing machines in our tests, scoring a Very Good or an Excellent in this test. The\u00a0 Whirlpool WFW85HEFW , $810, scored an Excellent, using 7 gallons to wash our test load, and did a very good job cleaning. View photos Sensible Ways to Add Water to Your Washer Forget about adding water from an outside source. Instead use the washer's settings to increase the amount of water for a load. Front-loaders, HE top-loaders, and some newer agitator\u00a0washers rely on a load-sensing feature to adjust the amount of water, based on the weight of the load. You cab can boost water use with a heavy-soil setting; heavy-duty cycle; bulky-items cycle; extra-rinse \u00a0 option; fabric-softener option; or deep-fill option. Manufacturers' websites might offer other options, and some, including\u00a0 Whirlpool , tell you how to reset your high-efficiency washer to the water levels set at the factory, important if your washer seems to be using less water than it first did.

One of them most likely depicts the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh Ramses II, who ruled Egypt over 3,000 years ago, while the other one is a limestone statue of the 12th century B.C. ruler Seti II. The statues were discovered near the entrance of the temple of Ramses II, which is situated in Heliopolis, an ancient city in the eastern part of modern-day Cairo. The discovery, made by the country's antiquities ministry, has been hailed as\u00a0extremely important. \"Last Tuesday they called me to announce the big discovery of a colossus of a king, most probably Ramses II, made out of quartzite,\" Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani  told Reuters on Thursday  at the site where the statues were unveiled. The archeologists said that the statue likely to be of the Ramses II measures\u00a0eight meters (26.24 feet)\u00a0and the other one, whose upper part was found, is said to be 80 centimeters (31.5 inches)\u00a0long. \"We found the bust of the statue and the lower part of the head and now we removed the head and we found the crown and the right ear and a fragment of the right eye,\" Anani said, while speaking about the Ramses II statue. The archeologists said they will now try to unearth the remaining portions of the statues before they finally restore them. If they are successful,\u00a0and if the statue is identified as Ramses II's,\u00a0it will be placed at the entrance of the Grand Egyptian Museum, which is expected to open in 2018.

Dietrich Raue, who headed the German team, also said that the excavation was important and added that parts of the statues were being taken to some other place for restoration. \"The sun god created the world in Heliopolis, in Matariya. That's what I always tell the people here when they say is there anything important. According to the pharaonic belief, the world was created in Matariya,\" Raue said. \"That means everything had to be built here. Statues, temples, obelisks, everything. But ... the king never lived in Matariya, because it was the sun god living here.\" The discovery comes close on the heels of the excavation of remains of a 600 B.C. palace in Mosul, Iraq.\u00a0The remains, found under the ruins of a shrine destroyed by ISIS, are believed to date back to\u00a0the Assyrian empire,  according to the Telegraph . \"I can only imagine how much Daesh (ISIS) discovered down there before we got here,\"\u00a0archeologist Layla Salih told the Telegraph. She has been supervising the team that is identifying the unearthed pieces one after the other. \"We believe they took many of the artifacts, such as pottery and smaller pieces, away to sell.

Read:    WikiLeaks Vault 7: Julian Assange Says Site Will Give CIA Hacking Tools To Tech Firms   \"We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out,\" Assange said in a press conference at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. However, Silicon Valley believes the leaks aren\u2019t that much of a concern and are instead worried about Assange\u2019s alleged ties to Russia, the   Guardian   reported. \u201cThe fact that Julian Assange is offering to selectively disclose vulnerability information to affected companies is better than revealing it to all and sundry, but it depends on the veracity, accuracy and currency of that information,\u201d BullGuard CEO Paul Lipman told the   Guardian  . \u201cI don\u2019t think WikiLeaks is the first stop for tech companies looking to solve vulnerabilities,\u201d he added. Apple addressed the exploits mentioned in Vault 7 on Wednesday, stating the   vulnerabilities had already been fixed . Meanwhile, Google said it had reviewed the documents and   believed that its operating systems were secure  and not at risk of an attack.   Read:    Apple: Security Flaws Allowing CIA Spying iOS Users Already Fixed   Julian Assange and Russia During the press conference, Assange tried to back away from accusations linking him to Russia and said the WikiLeaks operation was \u201ca neutral, digital Switzerland.\u201d However, some experts question the organization\u2019s motives, pointing to alleged ties between WikiLeaks and Russia. \u201cEverything they have done over the last few months suggests they are operating as a front for a different leaker [Russia],\u201d Ryan Kalember, SVP of Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint, told the   Guardian  . Kalember added the apparent ties to the Kremlin and WikiLeaks\u2019 record of publishing identifying information about individuals has dwindled trust in the organization. \u201cNo one in the information security community really trusts him and his motives,\u201d he said. \u201cI think at this point Assange is effectively acting in the service of the Russian government, whether intentionally or not,\u201d said Kalember. Assange has been viewed as favoring Trump after WikiLeaks released hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta last year. Top U.S. intel officials believe   Russia hacked Democrats  to help President Donald Trump win the election last November. A Russian state-backed group called Cozy Bear is believed to be behind the DNC hacks last year. The release of hacked documents had a major impact on Clinton\u2019s presidency bid, leading her to lose the election to Trump.

This is how the Trump presidency begins, and the American Century ends. I don\u2019t say this in a way that\u2019s gloomy or hysterical; don\u2019t count me among those who assume the nation is headed off a cliff. (Count me, instead, among those who think the odds of us doing all this again in three years or less are about 50-50.) I\u2019m only saying that political epochs, like the one into which every one of us was born, have demarcation points that can only be clearly seen in retrospect. And we\u2019re living through one right now. Any calendar will tell you, for instance, that the 19th century ended in 1901, the year President McKinley was assassinated and Teddy Roosevelt took his place. But most historians would argue that, for any practical purpose, the previous century of British dominance \u2014 Pax Britannica and all that \u2014 really saw the curtain fall in 1914, at the onset of the First World War. The empire would hold together for another 30 years after that, give or take, but beginning with the campaign against Germany and its allies, the orchestra was playing Britain off center stage. The costs of planetary preeminence, already a burden in peace, were unsustainable in war. View photos The 20th century as we think of it probably began about 30 years later, after Franklin Roosevelt solidified American dominance over the western half of a globe riven by ideology. From then on, Washington was at the epicenter of world events, the seat of unrivaled might among free nations. America was the most expansive country in the world, but whereas Britain had chiefly expanded its physical domain, we expanded our standard of living at a staggering rate. We expanded our markets to much of the world, education to all reaches of the country and \u2014 at long last \u2014 civil rights to the citizenry. We expanded the cultural reach of America \u2014 movies and sitcoms, soft drinks and sports teams, transcendent celebrity and defiant individualism \u2014 to every hamlet on earth where you could string an electrical wire. But just as the British Empire strained to maintain its momentum in the decades leading up to World War I, so too did our vast expansion run up against the boundaries of time and technology. Globalism, made possible by cheaper technologies and transportation, gave rise to competitors, even as automation made our own workers redundant. Factory towns cratered. The price of maintaining global hegemony, both in lives and in credit, became harder to justify. Government continued to grow, but now so did the chasm between the rich and everyone else. Still, well into the 21st century, the nation\u2019s political establishment clung tenaciously to this ideal of an essential, expansive America. It was at the heart of George W. Bush\u2019s calamitous adventure in Iraq and of his party\u2019s bid to create a new federal program for prescription drugs. It was the vision behind Barack Obama\u2019s health care plan, his pact with Iran and his failed effort to forge a new  market in Asia . And it\u2019s precisely what Donald Trump\u2019s election repudiates. Trump has said all kinds of conflicting things about almost everything; I expect he\u2019ll contradict himself a half dozen times on the Capitol steps alone. But in this one respect he has been faithful: He believes the time has come for withdrawal and isolation, rather than expansion and globalism. View photos Trump rejects free trade. He rejects our disproportionate role in the military defense of Europe and the West. He rejects the diversifying of our culture and the opening of our borders. He embraces the kind of tariffs that were once thought the relic of an old international system. He would cede the shaping of markets to a Chinese leadership that now, improbably, seems to be the world\u2019s largest cheerleader for trade. He imagines profound beauty in a wall. Ronald Reagan, to whom Trump would like to compare himself, defied his critics by reaffirming our global ambition to enemies abroad. Trump launches his presidency by  telling our allies  we\u2019ve had enough. His antipathy toward the political establishment is an antipathy toward globalism itself. His ambition is personal, not national. His promise to make America great is a promise only to a subset of Americans to whom modernity has been callous. It is a vision that resonates widely. In fact, it is the only aspect of Trump that does. A poll by the Washington Post and ABC News this week found that Trump arrives in Washington with the  lowest approval rating  of any president-elect in 40 years \u2014 about half as much support as Obama had at the same time in 2009. Remarkably, though, Trump inspires enviable confidence when it comes to creating jobs and stopping terrorism. Americans may not countenance a literal wall, but they see promise in the idea of hunkering down for a while, of trying to do a little less abroad and at home. You can say this is only a momentary digression. You can imagine that Trump represents a kind of national catharsis, after which we will get ourselves together and continue on with the sober business of statecraft and global leadership. But here\u2019s the thing: Once you leave a vacuum, it\u2019s not so easy to step back in and say you were only messing around. Economic rules get written. Rising powers exploit the moment. The world looks elsewhere for predictability. This is what Vladimir Putin understands, by the way. This is why he loves Trumpism. Russians are nothing if not patient, and they\u2019ve been waiting about 75 years for this moment. View photos Even as Trump prepares to place his hand on a Bible, the world is shucking its reverence for American democracy, aghast at our penchant for triviality. When I was in Australia last summer, when Trump was just a nominee, the comment I heard again and again from the political elite was some version of:  What exactly do you people think you\u2019re doing? Do you not get how much the world relies on your stability? Yes, we get it. And apparently we\u2019re tired of it. No offense, but we\u2019re all expanded out over here. Of course America can still be great in the decades ahead. (And yes, Mr. President-elect, it is.) We\u2019re bound by demographics to become a more diverse, more enlightened country, not less so. We remain the world\u2019s leading exporter of culture and consumerism. We\u2019re awash in technological talent, and we command more military machinery than any nation in history. But like the British before us, we\u2019re increasingly reconciled to being one power among many \u2014 to act modestly on our own behalf, rather than grandly in the service of what Joe Biden,  speaking at Davos  this week, called the \u201cliberal international world order.\u201d The vastness of America\u2019s vision gives way now to the smallness of Trump\u2019s appeal.

After 16 years of combat in the Middle East and Afghanistan, the United States is ramping up. Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, told Congress Thursday that he\u2019ll likely recommend troop increases in Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria in the coming months. It\u2019s unclear what the Trump administration will do with any such request, but given the  president\u2019s calls to crush  ISIS \u201cquickly,\u201d it\u2019s likely that the troops will soon be moving out. The call for more troops \u201ccomes amid rapid changes already happening in the U.S. military posture in the region,\u201d  FP\u2019s Paul McLeary  and  Dan De Luce   point out . Just this week, hundreds of U.S. Marines deployed to Syria and U.S. Army special operations forces were rushed to northern Syria to act as a buffer between the U.S.-backed fighters and Turkish-backed militias. American warplanes have also unleashed a new wave of bombing runs on al Qaeda in Yemen. More  from FP : \u201cThe deployments raise questions about the overall U.S. policy in the Middle East and other hotspots like Somalia or northern Africa. U.S. military commanders have been careful not to portray the recent moves as a broad change in existing policy, but instead as plans long in the works. One former Obama administration official told FP that the strikes in Yemen and troop increases in Syria are \u2018really more of a continuation than a departure from Obama administration counterterrorism policy,\u2019 albeit significantly accelerated from the ponderous way the Obama team made its decisions.\u201d Yemen.  A week of U.S. airstrikes on al Qaeda in Yemen has also raised questions over what the future U.S. role in that country\u2019s bloody civil war might be. \u201cBut bolder military action without a clear diplomatic plan can bring unintended consequences,\u201d  De Luce  and  McLeary  write  in another story . \u201cFocusing narrowly on the military objective of counterterrorism strikes without a strategy to resolve the stalemated Yemeni civil war \u2014 and address Saudi and Iranian involvement there \u2014 will do little to bring stability to the country, or solve the underlying ethnic and religious tensions that have allowed al Qaeda\u2019s branch there to flourish, experts said.\u201d Raid fallout.  A Jan. 29 Navy SEAL raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen has created controversy after the death of one SEAL,  as many as  14 civilians, and the crash of a $70 million U.S. aircraft. Gen. Votel said Thursday he\u2019s  taking responsibility  for the raid. The general told the Senate Armed Services Committee, \u201cI am the CENTCOM commander and I am responsible for what\u2019s done in my region and what\u2019s not done in my region. So I accept the responsibility for this. We lost a lot on this operation.\u201d Votel\u2019s ownership of the operation follows a controversial statement from President Trump disclaiming responsibility for the operation. Referring vaguely to \u201cthe generals,\u201d Trump told Fox News that \u201cthey lost Ryan\u201d \u00a0\u2014 Chief Petty Officer William Ryan Owens, the SEAL killed in the operation. Back in Syria.  Things are getting worse between Turkey and the Kurds. Turkish forces and their Syrian Arab allies said Friday  they killed  over 70 Kurdish fighters in northern Syria this week, and Syrian Kurds  said they can take  Raqqa by themselves, and reject Washington\u2019s efforts to enlist Turkish help. Turkish and Kurd forces are currently skirmishing near the city of Manbij, with American special forces having recently deployed to act as a buffer between the two sides. There have also been  pictures  of  Russian troops  with the U.S. trained and equipped Kurds, as Moscow continues to make itself into a player in any possible deal between the Kurds and Turkey. Still, Turkey says  it has hope  for good relations with the trump administration. Marine scandal widens.  What started as a scandal over a Marine Corps-themed Facebook page whose members shared naked pictures and identifying information \u2014 along with explicit calls for sexual assault \u2014 of female Marines has grown.  Business Insider   reports that  \u201chundreds of nude photos of female service members from every military branch have been posted to an image-sharing message board that dates back to at least May. A source informed Business Insider of the site\u2019s existence on Tuesday. The site, called AnonIB, has a dedicated board for military personnel that features dozens of threaded conversations among men, many of whom ask for \u201cwins\u201d \u2014 naked photographs \u2014 of specific female service members, often identifying the women by name or where they are stationed.\u201d The new revelation comes after the original scoop by  journalist Thomas Brennan . He uncovered the Marines United facebook group, which hosted approximately 30,000 members. Welcome to SitRep.

An in-depth investigation by  The Intercept   takes a look at the controversial U.S.  special operations raid  in Yemen that resulted in the death of a U.S. Navy Seal and several Yemeni civilians. The news outlet reports that the raid was not, as the White House has claimed, an attempt to collect intelligence but instead was aimed at killing Qassim al Rimi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Residents of the village initially believed that the raid was being carried out by Houthi forces. After coming under heavy fire, the SEAL team called in air support. Locals describe Apache helicopters firing indiscriminately and causing many of the casualties among civilians in the village.  Tests.  Satellite imagery of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site shows that Pyongyang is gearing up for  another test  at some point.  38 North  reviewed imagery of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site and found signs of activity at the portals leading to the underground test tunnel consistent with signs of preparation for a test. While the site is now capable of supporting a nuclear test on short notice, it\u2019s impossible to tell so far when the next test might take place. Retaliation.  The U.S. has already deployed its controversial ballistic missile defense system to South Korea, but China is still  putting the squeeze  on South Korea to show its continued anger at the decision.  Reuters  reports that Chinese travel and tourism companies have been pressured to cut off flights and cruise stops at South Korean tourist citizens popular with Chinese travelers as a result of Seoul\u2019s decision to host the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery in the south of the country. The U.S. and China say the THAAD battery is there only to defend against North Korean missiles but China is wary of the THAAD radar\u2019s ability to reach into its own territory. Discipline.  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey  intervened  to remove mention of a two star general\u2019s misuse of government resources to carry on an affair, according to a  USA Today  investigation. The incident took place when Dempsey was commander of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and Dempsey\u2019s intervention in the investigation of Maj. Gen. John Custer \u2014 then in command of the Army Intelligence Center and School at Fort Huachuca \u2014 led a review board to go easy on the general, allowing him to retire at full rank and pension. The Army inspector general found that Custer had ordered his staff to buy racy clothing for the woman he was having an affair with. Custer was also found to have sent racist and sexist emails. Kidnap plot.  Israeli authorities have arrested a man whom they allege was  planning to kidnap  an Israeli citizen on behalf of Hezbollah and smuggle him to Lebanon.  Ynet News  reports that Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence service Shin Bet alleges that Yousef Yasser Sweilam was recruited by Hezbollah over Facebook and instructed to surveil various targets across Israel, including from military. Hezbollah\u2019s kidnapping of Israeli soldiers in 2006 triggered a month-long war between Israel and the terrorist group. Detention . Attorney General Jeff Sessions says he\u2019d be ok with  adding new prisoners  to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and trying them in military courts instead of civilian federal ones. Interviewed for a talk radio show, Sessions described Guantanamo as \u201ca very fine place for holding these kinds of dangerous criminals.\u201d He also expressed skepticism about the trials of terrorists in federal civilian courts, lamenting that accused terrorists \u201cget discovery rights to find out our intelligence and get court-appointed lawyers and things of that nature.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 Photo Credit: DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP/Getty Images", "description": "Marine Sexual Harassment Scandal Grows; North Korea Prepares for More Tests; Jeff Sessions Loves Gitmo; Turks and Kurds Trade Fire; And Lots More", "title": "SitRep: New Deployments in Old Wars; General Takes Responsibility for SEAL Raid; New Yemen Bombing Runs"}

Now the Netherlands is grappling with some new unwelcome meddlers: Americans.  Several wealthy Americans bankrolled the campaign of Geert Wilders, the country\u2019s far-right, anti-EU, and anti-immigrant candidate according to new  campaign finance records  the Dutch government released this week. One right-wing activist, David Horowitz, donated $150,000 to Wilders\u2019s Party for Freedom (PVV) between 2015 and 2017. It\u2019s a drop in the bucket in American terms, but the money goes much further in a small western European country that relies heavily on public funds for elections. Horowitz\u2019s 2015 donations to PVV \u2014 $120,000 \u2014 was the country\u2019s largest individual political donation that year, the record shows.  \u201cReceiving such large sums from individual donors is highly unusual in our political landscape,\u201d Sijbren de Jong, an analyst with the Dutch-based Hague Center for Strategic Studies, told  Foreign Policy .  The American involvement comes amid a spate of election meddling by Russia. The Netherlands, France, and Germany have all sounded the alarm bells over Kremlin plots to empower anti-establishment political movements and pump cleverly-disguised propaganda and misinformation into their upcoming elections. And the United States is still reeling from revelations the Kremlin influenced its own 2016 elections to try and tip the scales in favor of President Donald Trump.  The U.S.\u00a0donations have stirred concerns in the Netherlands. \u201cIt\u2019s foreign interference in our democracy,\u201d Ronald van Raak, a member of parliament for Socialist party told the  New York Times . \u201cWe would not have thought that people from other countries would have been interested in our politics,\u201d van Raak said. \u201cMaybe we underestimated ourselves,\u201d he added. Wilders is widely known as the \u201c Dutch Donald Trump \u201d for his bombastic rhetoric, anti-immigrant stances, and savvy use of social media. He was  convicted of hate speech  in December last year. He is running on an anti-Islam  platform , advocating policies that include banning immigrants from Muslim countries, closing all the country\u2019s mosques, withdrawing from the EU, and closing the Netherlands\u2019 open borders policy.  The PVV is neck-and-neck in the polls with the establishment Liberal party for the country\u2019s parliamentary elections on March 15. Despite strong\u00a0poll numbers, it\u2019s unlikely Wilders would win the prime ministership. The Dutch parliamentary system requires a majority 75 seats to form a government and traditional parties on the left and right have vowed not to form a government with the PVV. The PVV is expected to win between 24 and 28 parliamentary seats and 16 percent of the country\u2019s vote. Despite stirring controversy at home, Wilders found an ally in Horowitz, who has called him \u201cthe Paul Revere of Europe.\u201d As Horowitz put it to  Buzzfeed News  last June, \u201cHe\u2019s somebody with incredible courage,\u201d making a \u201clast ditch stand for democracy.\u201d     Horowitz runs the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a California-based think tank dedicated to \u201ccombat[ing] the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror.\u201d The Center did not immediately respond to  FP\u2019s \u00a0request for comment.

In an era where many cars are getting \"softer\", Hyundai has turned away from the fad in efforts of developing the Sonata from an econo-box to a respectable choice for buyers. A bold front fascia displays itself with a redesigned hood and headlight design, complimenting the cars \"cascading\" grill. The same trend continues from front to rear, promising an equally handsome profile. The Sonatas interior receives a going-over as well. Nifty features include wireless smartphone charging and an 8-inch display with navigation, showing Hyundais more adult side. The brands latest  Blue Link infotainment system  is a nice bit of kit, allowing for easy accessibility to the Sonatas features. Driver aids include an active safety suite that provide drivers with blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, and adaptive headlights. All of these culminate to show that the automaker is beginning to shy away from its budget roots, giving us quality products at a still considerably low price. Powertrain options were also released for the global market. Outside of the U.S., the Sonata will be treated to a 1.7L turbo diesel option that we arent likely to see here. A 2.0L I4 will be the standard lump with a 1.6L turbo being optional as an alternative eco-conscious choice. There will be a two-liter turbo that makes 240 HP as well, promising plenty of giddy-up to match exclusively with the eight speed automatic.

In a closed-door meeting earlier this week with conservative lawmakers and groups who have raised objections to the controversial replace plan, Trump  said that Democrats would take the blame  if the GOP cannot reach an agreement on it and the bill fails, according to CNN. Trump has made a similar claim several times in the past. \u201cFrom a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing,\u201d he told supporters at CPAC last month. \u201cLet it implode completely \u2014 it\u2019s already imploding. You see the carriers are all leaving. I mean, it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d Trump said Democrats would \u201cbeg\u201d for help when that happened, and it would be \u201ctheir problem.\u201d But the president added, \u201cIt\u2019s not the right thing to do,\u201d and Republicans should fix the system.   massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight \u2013 be careful!   \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  January 4, 2017   Should Democrats be concerned that the health care exchanges, which cover 12 million Americans, will \u201cimplode\u201d and they\u2019ll take the political blame? Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was defiant when asked about this on Thursday, saying she believed that Trump would be fully responsible. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president really knows what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d she said, adding that many of the people who benefited from the Affordable Care Act live in red states that voted for Trump and may turn on him if they see their care get worse. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage to about 20 million more Americans by\u00a0setting up state exchanges, where people could buy insurance with subsidies based on their income, and by giving states federal money to expand Medicaid to more of their populations. State exchanges have not attracted as many people as Democrats originally predicted, and some plans come with high deductibles that stick people with a big bill for care. Democrats argue that these problems could be fixed with a few tweaks, while Republicans have put forward their plan to gut and replace the subsidy system with an age-based tax credit. The individual market could see significant damage over the next year or two \u2014 though much of it through the Trump administration\u2019s own actions. The biggest risk to the exchanges is that insurers will decide not to participate next year because of rising premium costs, according to Washington and Lee University School of Law professor Timothy Jost, a health care expert. Most of the people who buy insurance on the exchanges \u2014 about 85 percent \u2014 will not be affected by premium hikes because their out-of-pocket premium expenses are limited by their annual income. However, if insurers decide to leave the market, many people could find that their state doesn\u2019t have an exchange anymore. \u201cThe individual insurance market is a small part of the business and has recently not been a very profitable part of the business for health insurers,\u201d Jost said. The Trump administration could take several steps that would push insurers out the door. The White House already scrapped television and radio ads during the last week of enrollment in January, which Jost believes led to a drop of younger enrollees who keep costs down. Trump also signed an executive order that suggests he may not enforce the individual mandate in the future, which would also likely cause younger and healthier people to leave the market. In the future, the administration could slow or block some government payments to the insurance companies for 2016 that have not yet come through, sending a message to the insurers to leave. Insurance company Humana already announced that it would leave the market before 2018,  citing instability . If the health care exchanges collapse next year, Jost believes it will be through the Trump administration\u2019s desire for them to do so, since there was evidence that costs were stabilizing last year. Insurers must decide by June 21 whether to participate in the individual markets next year. Americans in the exchanges will then begin to learn whether their coverage will be cut off in the future. But it remains to be seen whether Americans would blame the law\u2019s namesake \u2014 former President Barack Obama \u2014 and the Democratic Party for that failure. \u201cIf the Trump administration continues sabotaging the law, then they\u2019ll be responsible for the damage that causes to families,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a former Hillary Clinton campaign official now advising Democrats on health care. \u201cHe can\u2019t make us responsible for his bad decisions. If they break it, they own it.\u201d Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who opposed Trump, said she believes that Democrats will have a \u201ccompelling case\u201d that Republicans were in charge of the White House and Congress and didn\u2019t deliver on their promise to fix the health care system. And that argument would come right in time for the 2018 midterm elections. \u201cIf this becomes a bigger mess than it is now, Republicans in general better be ready to run really top-notch campaigns, because this isn\u2019t going to be as easy a cycle, I don\u2019t think, as they may have predicted,\u201d Mair said. Trump, however, is a different story. Mair believes the first-time politician could easily turn around and blame Republicans \u2014 not Democrats \u2014 for the mess and attempt to stay above the fray. \u201cHe\u2019d be perfectly happy to trash congressional Republicans for not sending a bill to his desk and then showing how bipartisan and \u2018for the people\u2019 he is by working with Democrats,\u201d she predicted.

Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, also urged GOP leaders in the House of Representatives to slow down in their replacement effort, and \"start over\" on their bill, known as the American Health Care Act. Cotton's admonitions, made in a series of early morning tweets, are the latest sign that the Republican House bill could face a very difficult road for winning passage in Congress.   Tweet     Tweet     Tweet   A number of conservative members of the House and Senate, as well as right-leaning think tanks and health analysts, have sharply criticized the bill promoted by the GOP leadership. Trump has said he supports the bill. Early Thursday afternoon, the president brushed aside growing skepticism about the proposal on Twitter.   Tweet   Cotton noted in one of his tweets that the House bill has yet to be \"scored\" by the Congressional Budget Office. That score would indicate the bill's expected effect on the federal budget, as well as how many Americans would be expected to lose, or gain, health insurance coverage if it were to become law. Democrats, who staunchly oppose replacing Obamacare, likewise have blasted House Republicans for rushing to pass the bill without first getting the CBO's estimates. Democrats have said the $600 billion in tax cuts that the bill would implement over a decade would drive up the federal deficit. And they expect the bill would lead to the loss of insurance for millions of people. GOP leaders are trying to kill and replace several major parts of Obamacare through the process known as budget reconciliation. If the Senate parliamentarian agrees that the bill qualifies for that process because it is budget-specific, Republicans would need just 50 votes in the Senate, where they hold 52 seats, to pass the proposal. But four GOP senators have already expressed opposition to the idea of rolling back gains made in Medicaid coverage under Obamacare, as the new GOP bill could well do. Other Republicans have objected to the bill's use of refundable tax credits to subsidize the purchase of private individual health insurance plans, while other GOP members opposed the defunding of Planned Parenthood in the bill. If the parliamentarian does not agree that bill can be passed through reconciliation, Republicans would need 60 senators to vote for the bill. That would likely be an impossible hurdle, given how firmly Democrats are opposed to it. Watch: Republicans push health care bill forward", "description": "Sen.

Research shows that hair loss has  measurable connections with heart disease  and an association (though not a direct cause-and-effect relationship) with  prostate cancer . A new  study  not only confirmed these previous health-related findings but also found that  men who are short appear to have an increased risk of premature hair loss .

The study, conducted in Germany using  subjects from seven countries ,  looked at the genetic makeup of thousands of men who suffer from premature hair loss \u2014 over 11,000 balding men \u2014 along with 12,000 men without hair loss as a control source. The researchers\u2019 findings isolated dozens of what geneticists are calling alterations in the human genome that increase the risk of premature hair loss. \u201cSome of these alterations were also found in connection with other characteristics and illnesses, such as reduced body size, earlier occurrence of puberty, and various cancers,\u201d explained one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Stefanie Heilmann-Heimbach, PhD, in a press release. Still, researchers in this field emphasize that balding men shouldn\u2019t panic. \u201cMen with premature hair loss do not need to be concerned,\u201c says the study\u2019s co-author, Markus N\u00f6then of the University of Bonn in Germany. \u201dThe risks of illness are only increased slightly.\u201d  If you happen to be one of the guys who is already displaying a relationship between your short height and baldness, well, you likely already know about it.

Essentially, the US's latest update to its\u00a0Trident missiles aboard US Navy submarines ensures that each and every single missile will explode at precisely the right moment to devastate any target. Because of this new \"super fuze,\" or timing element, the US's submarine-launched ballistic missile fleet has tripled in destructive potential, according to the report. This is important because US military planners previously only relied on submarine-launched missiles\u00a0to strike soft targets like military bases. Now these missiles could be used to wipe out Russia's nukes buried deep underground.\u00a0 \"Because of improvements in the killing power of US submarine-launched ballistic missiles, those submarines now patrol with more than three times the number of warheads needed to destroy the entire fleet of Russian land-based missiles in their silos,\" wrote Hans M. Kristensen, Matthew McKinzie, and Theodore A. Postol, the authors of the report. For more  news videos  visit  Yahoo View , available now on  iOS  and  Android . But the US has even bigger nukes which sit in missile silos underground as ICBMs. Historically, these missiles would have been used for destroying Russia's ICBMs, but since submarines can handle that now, the US can focus its\u00a0big nukes on obliterating underground hardened nuclear shelters \u2014 the kind Kremlin officials would hide out in during an attack. From a US perspective, submarine-launched nuclear missile capability has surged, but don't expect Russia to share the enthusiasm.\u00a0 Unlike the US, which can spot missile launches from space, Russia would have virtually no warning of an incoming missile besides its\u00a0ground-based radars, which have limited range.\u00a0 \"Russian military and political leaders would have no 'situational awareness' to help them assess whether an early-warning radar indication of a surprise attack is real or the result of a technical error,\" the scientists write. View photos nimbus b1 satellite nasa More (Without eyes in space, Russia would have to answer a very difficult question very quickly if they detected an incoming missile.NASA)  So Russian defense officials would have less than 15 minutes to decide if an incoming object was legitimate, where it was coming from, and how they should respond. This places a whole lot of responsibility on the shoulders of Russian military officials. \"The combination of this lack of Russian situational awareness, dangerously short warning times, high-readiness alert postures, and the increasing US strike capacity has created a deeply destabilizing and dangerous strategic nuclear situation,\" argues the piece.\u00a0 Read the full article here > NOW WATCH:  This animation shows how terrifyingly powerful nuclear weapons have become More From Business Insider  The US has been conducting a secret cyberwar against North Korea's nukes \u2014 with surprising results These 17 photos show Finland's brutally cold World War II battle with the Soviet Union Russian reality TV star and Playboy model detained at LAX on suspicions of being a spy", "description": "A recent report from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists details how the US massively upgraded the...", "title": "US nukes just got a lot deadlier \u2014 and experts say it could cause Russia to attack"}

The first of those debuted last year, achieving a range of 366 miles on a single tank of hydrogen. The automaker hopes that the latter two will help develop the Claritys global popularity, and it looks like theyll be revealed at the New York Auto Show later in the year. The Clarity Electric may be the most puzzling of this group. Whereas EVs have mostly become the best choice for those going green (and willing to pay for it), the Honda pitches a different strategy to buyers. Instead of bothering with large range figures, this Honda can only go 80 miles on one electric fill up according to  Automotive News.  Thats a recognizably small number, especially as mid-$30K EVs like the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3 will travel nearly three times that on one charge. The Plug-In Hybrid will be the volume push for the Clarity lineup. Its a  safe bet  thats been proven to work in a variety of markets, showing itself as a worthwhile venture for Honda. It will have an all-electric driving range of 40 miles, a moderate number for its class. The manufacturer claims it will be available in all 50 states, improving availability to increase sales. Each of the new models will compliment the Clarity Fuel Cell in unique ways. On one hand, we see why Honda wouldnt want the Clarity Electric to surpass the hydrogen car in range -- after all, thatd be aiding the enemy. Secondly, the plug-in hybrid should ensure higher sales success for the automaker, enabling further development of fuel cell technology. The current Clarity Fuel Cell poses major improvements over the FCX Clarity it replaces with a powerplant that is 33 percent smaller and has a 60 percent increase in power density.

(Photo: Giuseppe Ciccia/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) More Pope Francis warned against the rising tide of populism  in an interview  with German paper Die Zeit this week, reigniting an ongoing search for subliminal criticism of President Trump in the pope\u2019s words. \u201cPope Francis issues veiled warning about Donald Trump,\u201d  proclaimed the headline  on British news site the Independent about the interview, though Francis had not mentioned Trump. His statement, however, that \u201cpopulism is evil and ends badly as the past century showed,\u201d marks at least the second time in recent months that the pope has warned against the dangers of growing populist movements in the U.S. as well as Europe. His latest words echo similar pontifications made during an interview with  Spanish-language paper El Pais  on the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration. In that case, Francis cited Nazi Germany as the \u201cmost obvious example of populism in the European sense of the word,\u201d pointing to the fact that \u201cHitler didn\u2019t steal power, his people voted for him\u201d as proof that \u201cin times of crisis we lack judgment.\u201d He further urged people to resist the tendency to \u201clook for a savior who gives us back our identity and [lets] us defend ourselves with walls, barbed-wire, whatever, from other people who may rob us of our identity.\u201d In his Inauguration Day interview with El Pais, the pope once again refrained from commenting on the new president directly, choosing instead to wait and \u201csee how he acts, what he does\u201d before forming an opinion. But his general warning against politicians who emphasize the need for strong border enforcement and other travel restrictions falls in line with other comments the pope has made about arguably Trumpian policies before and after the brash real estate mogul entered the White House. In a weekly address at the Vatican early last month, the pope reportedly  issued an appeal  \u201cto not raise walls but bridges.\u201d Though his comments were relatively generic on their own, Francis went on to insist, \u201cA Christian can never say: \u2018I\u2019ll make you pay for that.\u2019\u201d Many interpreted the statement as a veiled critique of Trump\u2019s pledge to not only build a wall along the southern border of the U.S. but also make Mexico pay for it. In February of last year, the pope offered a more direct assessment of Trump\u2019s core campaign promise following a trip to Cuba and Mexico, which included a noteworthy stop in Juarez, a Mexican city near the U.S. border. \u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\u201d  Francis told reporters  when asked about then-candidate Trump. At the time,  Trump fired back at Francis , calling the comments \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d In  a lengthy statement , Trump said in part, \u201cIf and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS\u2019s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.\u201d Both sides soon backed down, insisting that the pope\u2019s initial words had been misinterpreted as an attack on Trump. View photos Pope Francis celebrates Ash Wednesday Mass at Santa Sabina church in Rome on March 1. (Photo: Vatican Pool/Getty Images) More Not entirely unlike the president himself, Francis has developed a penchant for expressing his views on Twitter.  A number of observers   read his recent posts  about embracing migrants and foreigners as a subtle rejection of the restrictive immigration policies of both Trump and right-wing parties in Europe. Despite the fact that Francis has yet to make an explicit statement regarding his views on the U.S. president, experts are also\u00a0eager to connect the dots. In a piece for the  New Yorker  earlier last month, former Catholic priest-turned-novelist James Carroll deemed Francis \u201cthe anti-Trump,\u201d arguing that \u201cPope Francis is, at this point, the world\u2019s staunchest defender of migrants, and of Muslim migrants.\u201d British journalist and papal biographer Austen Ivereigh offered a similar analysis at the  New York Times \u00a0on March 4, pointing to the pope\u2019s expressed support for Muslim immigrants and refugees as the biggest conflict between \u201cthe world\u2019s two most compelling populists.\u201d Without having technically derided the president by name, Ivereigh argued, \u201cPope Francis has become the flag-bearer of the global anti-Trump resistance.\u201d Read more from Yahoo News: Hawaii kicks off challenges to revised travel ban Obama said to be \u2018livid\u2019 with Trump wiretapping claim \u2018Day Without Women\u2019 looks to continue legacy of massive D.C. march In age of Trump, Democrats look to turn Orange County blue Photos: 10 women trailblazers you may not have heard of \u00a0 \u00a0", "description": "Pope Francis warned against the rising tide of populism in an interview with German paper Die Zeit this week, reigniting an ongoing search for subliminal criticism of President Trump in the pope\u2019s words.", "title": "Searching for Trump condemnation in Pope Francis\u2019 words"}

The halt was started in January by Ukrainian war veterans and volunteers who sought to prevent Russian-backed insurgents from receiving cash from trade with Kiev. Global steel giant ArcelorMittal expressed concern over the stoppage and said its operations near the war zone had been affected by the \"challenging situation\". A statement from the Luxembourg-based company said it had developed a \"crisis plan of operation\" due to the \"emergency state\" of the energy sector. But its stock still fell by nearly two percent in late afternoon European trading. ArcelorMittal bills itself as the world's largest integrated steel and mining company. Its operations in the war-scarred state make up just a fraction of its global production. But the company's message sent a clear signal to the pro-Western government of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that something needed to be done. Ukraine is hesitant to move against the strikers for fear of a backlash from nationalists who make up an important portion of the Ukrainian parliament. Poroshenko also needs to spend political capital on the passage of International Monetary Fund austerity measures required for Ukraine to receive urgent loans. - 'Possible risks' - ArcelorMittal has a plant in the mining city of Kryviy Rih that needs coal to produce steel. The city is in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region that is outside the war zone. Its website says the Kryviy Rih plant is the biggest exporter in Ukraine. The firm said it had already run out of certain types of coal that are \"crucial raw materials\" and said it was gearing up for \"possible electricity blackouts\" in the region. It said production was at normal levels but could be affected at any time. \"The company is concerned about the possible risks regarding future supplies,\" it said. The activists blocking the railway accuse corrupt Ukrainian authorities of allowing the flow of goods to fund the rebels. They say the rebels have smuggled contraband alcohol and tobacco into the rest of Ukraine along with the shipments of a specific type of coal found only in the east. The insurgents' leader in the separatist province of Donetsk on March 3 said he would retaliate by trading only with Russia. Rebels began exporting the coal to Russia on Monday and started taking over dozens of Ukrainian businesses in the separatist east earlier this month. Ukrainian Central Bank chief Valeria Gontareva has warned that a year-long blockade could shrink Ukraine's growth outlook for this year from 2.2 percent to 0.7 percent. Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said it could cost Ukraine some 75,000 jobs.", "description": "The biggest foreign investor in Ukraine expressed alarm Thursday over a weeks-long blockade of railway lines for transporting coal between the separatist east and the rest of the ex-Soviet state.

(AP) \u2014 An Argentine citizen who grew up in Mississippi and was detained after speaking out about President Donald Trump's policies was released from custody on Friday by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Daniela Vargas, 22, was released from a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, under an order of supervision, according to her attorneys. But her release won't end her legal challenge to avoid being deported, said Joshua Stehlik, a supervising attorney for the National Immigration Law Center. \"This does not in any way end the case,\" Stehlik told The Associated Press. \"We will still be pursuing the legal claims to challenge the order of removal.\" ICE spokesman Thomas Byrd confirmed Vargas was released but said he didn't have any additional information. Vargas' lawyers said the terms of her release weren't immediately clear. \"This is an ICE decision to release her. This is not court-ordered,\" Stehlik said. Vargas' attorneys expected her to return to Mississippi, where she was arrested by ICE agents on March 1 after speaking at a press conference outside Jackson City Hall that was organized by a coalition of civil rights lawyers and other advocates for immigrants. One of her friends, Jordan Sanders, said federal agents in unmarked cars pulled them over five minutes after they left. Abigail Peterson, another lawyer for Vargas, said her client was relieved to be out of custody. \"I think that she's doing pretty well given everything she's gone through,\" Peterson said. Vargas' parents brought her from Argentina when she was 7 under a visa wavier program, which allows immigrants to enter the U.S. without a visa for 90 days but denies them a hearing in front of a judge if they overstay. On March 6, her attorneys filed a petition in federal court urging the Department of Homeland Security to allow Vargas to remain in the U.S. until they can make her case before a judge. For now, Vargas is being processed as a \"visa wavier overstay,\" which could deny her a hearing and lead to her deportation to South America. Vargas went to high school in Morton, Mississippi, attended a community college and then enrolled at the University of Southern Mississippi, having twice obtained protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The DACA program \u2014 derided as \"illegal amnesty\" by critics \u2014 has protected about 750,000 immigrants since the Obama administration launched it in 2012. It allows young immigrants who arrived as children and are living in the U.S. illegally to stay and obtain work permits, good for two years at a time. Vargas' latest permit expired in November, and she hadn't been able to pay the $495 renewal fee until February, when she reapplied, according to Peterson. ___ Kunzelman reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7% and wages rose 2.8% over last year. But the big story in Friday\u2019s report isn\u2019t that wage growth bounced back or that the Federal Reserve now seems all but certain to raise rates next week. Rather, the big story is that people are coming back to the work force. This report, in other words, is all about participation. More Americans are participating in the labor force In February, the employment-to-population ratio rose to 60%,  the highest since February 2009 \u00a0and an indication that one of the most discouraging labor market trends of the last decade is starting to turn. Among prime-age workers \u2014 those between 25 and 54 \u2014 participation rose to 81.7% in February, the highest since 2011. At the height of the last cycle, prime age participation topped out at 83.4%. And looking at this prime-age cohort more closely, the biggest gains have been\u00a0been among millennials \u2014 ages 25 to 34 \u2014  with nonemployment falling below 22% \u00a0for this age group\u00a0after having been at 24% just a couple years ago. \u201cDigging into the labor force participation rate, the jump in the prime-age (25 to 54 years) labor force participation rate is especially heartening, rising to 81.7%, the highest since 2011,\u201d write Neil Dutta, an economist with Renaissance Macro. View photos Source: FRED More \u201cAll of the increase in the last month came from a surge in participation rates for prime-age women,\u201d Dutta added. \u201cYounger workers boosted their rates of labor force participation too; those aged 20 to 24 years saw their labor force participation rate climb to 71.7%, the highest since March 2014. The hotter the labor market runs, the more attractive it becomes to join the labor market at the margin.\u201d View photos Jobseekers wait at a career fair in Hartford, CT. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) More The labor force participation rate also rose in February to 63%, the highest since March 2014\u00a0and the continuation of a stabilization in this measure\u00a0that began back in 2015. Since December, the number of people in the workforce has grown by 416,000 while those not in the labor has dropped by 912,000. So\u00a0not only are people getting jobs, but those who hadn\u2019t even been looking are now trying to find work. Back in November, Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari  told Yahoo Finance \u00a0that the labor market story in 2016 had been one of participation.\u00a0And while a long-term chart of labor participation still looks disappointing,\u00a0seeing workers brought from the margins back into the labor force is a positive turn against a long-term demographic trend. Wage growth,  which in February\u00a0rose 2.8% over the prior year , is certainly a tailwind for labor force participation. But if\u00a0there\u2019s one thing that the post-election economy has been about it is a confidence boost among consumers and businesses now that Donald Trump is president, and joining or re-joining the labor force is certainly a decision that requires one to have confidence in their prospects. And while overall participation still faces demographic headwinds \u2014 Boomers retiring en masse will keep a lid on this figure to some extent \u2014 a strong labor market can still clearly draw in workers of prime working age who had been pushed to the economic margins. \u201cLabor force participation rates face long-run, secular headwinds that go beyond a short-run cyclical improvement drawing workers back into the labor market,\u201d write economists at Wells Fargo. \u201cThere is no quick fix, but focusing on improving both the quality and quantity of the labor force will be key to driving faster, sustainable economic growth.\u201d \u2014 Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

(AP) More The  Golden State Warriors \u2019 current slump has been one of the most fascinating developments of the season, a sharp turn in a story that once appeared headed towards yet another NBA Finals matchup with LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Then  Kevin Durant  went down with a knee injury, and now the Warriors look exhausted and in need of much more than rest. With the  San Antonio Spurs  on a roll and the No. 1 seed in the West up for grabs, Saturday\u2019s matchup between the Warriors and Spurs at the AT&T Center has looked like a turning point in deciding who gets homefield advantage throughout the playoffs and how the Warriors bounce back from their worst stretch of play in several seasons. [ Tourney Pick\u2019em is open! Sign up now  |  Bracket Big Board ] Saturday\u2019s game still matters a great deal to the standings, but it\u2019s now far from appointment viewing. The Warriors lost for the fourth time in their last six on Friday night, dropping a tight contest to the  Minnesota Timberwolves   103-102 . At 53-12, Golden State is just 1 1/2 games ahead of San Antonio for the No. 1 seed and could see that lead dwindle to a mere half-game (with no separation in the loss column) should they lose on the second night of a back-to-back. Yet head coach Steve Kerr is not putting pressure on his team to win that game. In fact, he\u2019s resting his four best active players:   Coach Kerr announced that Curry (rest), Green (rest), Iguodala (rest) & Thompson (rest) will not play tomorrow night in San Antonio.   \u2014 Warriors PR (@WarriorsPR)  March 11, 2017   Kerr explained the decision in some detail.  From Chris Haynes of ESPN.com :   \u201cWe\u2019re going to get [to San Antonio] at 3 am,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThose guys are all playing big minutes, and this would give them three days before our home game, and then we\u2019ll have a whole week at home next week and a chance to get recharged.     \u201cIt\u2019s my call, and it\u2019s the right thing to do in terms of the way the season is playing out and the way the minutes have gone and KD\u2019s injury. It\u2019s the right thing to do, so we\u2019re doing it.\u201d     Iguodala was asked if he knew about Kerr\u2019s decision before Friday\u2019s game.     \u201cNope, no clue,\u201d he said. \u201cI do what master say.\u201d     His comment drew a swift and angry response on social media, with some interpreting it as a shot at Kerr. Iguodala later clarified his remark to ESPN, saying it was in no way a shot directed at Kerr and that it was only an inside locker room joke.     \u201cMe and Steve are cool,\u201d Iguodala told ESPN. \u201c[People] can think what they want to think.\u201d   Iguodala could have chosen his words better, but the reaction to them probably says more about the state of the Warriors than anything he did. Golden State has now lost four of six for the first time in the Steve Kerr era and could experience a three-game losing streak with a loss on Saturday. To put that in perspective, the Warriors had gone 146 straight games without losing two in a row before dropping games to the Wizards and Bulls last week. The news follows the Spurs\u2019 Friday announcement that  MVP candidate Kawhi Leonard would miss the game  after entering the league\u2019s concussion protocol. That\u2019s bad news for neutrals \u2014 what looked like one of the biggest games of the season will now feature around 40 minutes of Patrick McCaw and Matt Barnes. And it could get worse if Gregg Popovich matches Kerr by resting key veterans like LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol. [Follow Ball Don\u2019t Lie on social media:  Twitter  |  Instagram  |  Facebook  |  Tumblr ] It\u2019s tempting to say that the Warriors will sit these players because of their recent loss, but the performance pointed to the necessity of rest regardless of the result. Golden State will finish off a run of eight games in different cities over a span of just 13 days on Saturday, and the effects of playing seven of those games without Durant have been glaring. The Warriors have looked exhausted and are experiencing a three-point shooting slump totally at odds with their reputation as a dominant perimeter side. Golden State has shot worse than 30 percent from three-point range with no more than eight conversions in all four of their recent losses. The worst struggles have come from an unexpected source. Stephen Curry is just 18-of-76 from deep (23.7 percent) for in the Warriors\u2019 last seven games, a middling level of performance that has become downright disastrous without Durant around to take pressure off him.   Feel like I can overanalyze a lot of GSW factors but none are bigger than \"Steph Curry keeps missing open shots\"   \u2014 Ethan Strauss (@SherwoodStrauss)  March 11, 2017   That\u2019s not to say Curry has been bad. In fact, he has proven his worth as a driver and creative finisher, which came into play on Friday. Down 17 points to Minnesota in the second quarter, Golden State battled back to have a chance to win late. When Curry made a floater with 19 seconds left, the Warriors took a 102-101 lead and looked in position to pull off their biggest comeback of the season. Then, just seven seconds later, Andrew Wiggins drew a foul and made two free throws to take the lead right back. The Warriors had a chance to win, but Curry missed a mid-range jumper. Klay Thompson made an effort for the ball and tied up Brandon Rush to force a jump, but referees determined there were just 0.7 seconds on the clock: The tip itself was enough to run out the clock, and the Wolves ended up with their eighth win in their last 12 games. There are ways to spin this loss for the Warriors. They showed fight in coming back, nearly won, and were the victim of several questionable calls late. But these are nevertheless unfamiliar explanations for a team so used to winning since Kerr became head coach. The Warriors aren\u2019t just losing games \u2014 they look gassed on virtually every possession and aren\u2019t succeeding in the one area of the game that usually comes naturally. Saturday\u2019s rest should help, but it will also come as a relief. The Warriors have never looked so in need of a break. \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Eric Freeman  is a writer for  Ball Don\u2019t Lie  on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

Penzone unseated longtime incumbent Joe Arpaio. (Photo: Matt York/AP) More PHOENIX, Ariz. \u2014 Last Friday morning, Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone walked a few blocks from his office in downtown Phoenix to Arizona State University\u2019s Cronkite School of Journalism, where he patiently took questions from a room full of Latino journalism students from high schools around the county. Predictably, many of their questions concerned immigration: They wanted to know more about Penzone\u2019s new policy on detaining immigrants at local jails, and about recent immigration arrests, like that of  Juan Carlos Fomperosa Garc\u00eda , a single father of three who was detained and processed for deportation after he had checked in at an office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the night before. For several students in attendance, the questions weren\u2019t just journalistic, but personal. The event was part of Penzone\u2019s effort to repair the relationships of the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office with the people it serves \u2014 including the more than 1.2 million residents of Hispanic or Latino origin who were, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, systematically persecuted under the policies of Penzone\u2019s predecessor, Joe Arpaio. With just over 4 million residents, including Anglo retirees from California and the Midwest, Latino migrants and college students, the sprawling county accounts for 60 percent of the state\u2019s population. Its biggest city, Phoenix, also has the  highest concentration  of undocumented immigrants of any major metropolitan area in the country. And last November, Maricopa County  gave Donald Trump  more votes than any other county in the United States. \u201cYou know who got more votes than Trump?\u201d Penzone asked during a recent interview with Yahoo News, referring to the election results in Maricopa County. \u201cI did.\u201d Although he was among Trump\u2019s earliest and most conspicuous supporters, Arpaio, whose endorsement had become a much-sought-after prize for Republican presidential primary contenders, lost his own bid for re-election after 24 years in office. Penzone, a veteran of the Phoenix police department who ran as a Democrat, maintains\u00a0that his victory had less to do with politics \u2014 which he insists \u201chas no place in law enforcement\u201d \u2014 than it did with voters\u2019 overwhelming fatigue with \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff.\u201d Arpaio\u2019s\u00a0controversial crusade against illegal immigration left the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office in financial disarray, with a backlog of unsolved sex crimes. There was also\u00a0a department-wide pattern of unconstitutional and discriminatory treatment of Latinos\u00a0that amounted to what  an investigator with the U.S. Department of Justice called  the \u201cmost egregious\u201d pattern of \u201cracial profiling in the United States.\u201d View photos In this Feb. 4, 2009, file photo, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, left, orders approximately 200 convicted illegal immigrants handcuffed together and moved into a separate area of Tent City, for incarceration until their sentences were served and they were deported to their home countries. (Photo: Ross D. Franklin, File/AP) More \u201cThe brand of this organization was about things such as pink underwear and tanks,\u201d said Penzone. He was referring to signature Arpaio stunts like the emasculating undergarments that are worn by inmates at Maricopa County\u2019s infamous Tent City jail, and to\u00a0the time he and television \u201cLawman\u201d Steven Seagal accompanied several sheriff\u2019s deputies on a military-style raid on an alleged cockfighting ring, knocking down the suspect\u2019s front door with a tank. \u201cThe tank will go,\u201d Penzone said decisively. Tent City, the 24-year-old unventilated facility built from Korean War-era Army surplus tents, whose notoriously dismal conditions have been deemed inadequate and unconstitutional by federal judges in the past, is currently under evaluation by the newly constituted \u201cSheriff Penzone\u2019s Executive Advisory Review\u201d (SPEAR) committee. With the help of advisory committees, including committees for outreach to Hispanic, African-American and LGBTQ communities, and with new leaders both within the department and from outside, Penzone hopes to change his office\u2019s reputation to one of \u201cprofessionalism,\u201d ethics and \u201cintegrity.\u201d This vision is shared by many in Maricopa County, from the immigrant activists who  led a grassroots campaign  to unseat Arpaio to the traditionally conservative editorial board of the Arizona Republic, which endorsed Penzone in his campaign, citing his \u201crefreshing\u201d interest in carrying out the basic duties of law enforcement and public safety. Despite this broad foundation of support, less than two months after Penzone was sworn into office, he got a taste of political backlash, throwing Maricopa County back into the national spotlight with his first major act as sheriff. On the evening of Friday, Feb. 17,  Penzone announced  that the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office would no longer comply with ICE requests for courtesy holds \u2014 a past practice under which the county\u2019s jails would detain people upon ICE\u2019s request for up to 48 hours after a judge had ordered their release. The decision, which Penzone says he made after he was informed by the Maricopa County attorney\u2019s office that the practice was unconstitutional, came as a bit of a shock, given the history of the Sheriff\u2019s Office, as well as the debate raging over local law enforcement\u2019s role in immigration. It was immediately applauded by immigrant rights activists and condemned by proponents of strict immigration enforcement, such as the powerful  Republican state Sen. John Kavanagh . Penzone says that before announcing the change in policy, he consulted with ICE to seek an alternative, legally viable solution. But the agency responded to the new policy with a statement calling it an \u201cimmediate, dangerous change.\u201d Soon, a suspiciously-sourced statistic claiming that Penzone would now release 400 \u201ccriminal illegal aliens\u201d every 10 days was being circulated across social media and right-wing blogs. \u201cAs far as I can tell, that\u2019s a completely made-up figure \u2014 like, truly, really fake news\u201d said Mark Casey, director of public information at the Sheriff\u2019s Office. According to his figures, the number of detainees with ICE hold requests released in the first 10 days of the new policy was 106. But the following Friday,  Penzone\u2019s office announced a revision to its policy to accommodate ICE concerns. While still declining to honor ICE requests for \u201ccourtesy holds\u201d in the county\u2019s own jails, the Sheriff\u2019s Office would now notify the agency in advance of the pending release of persons flagged for possible immigration violations \u2014 once when processing for their release began, and again 15 minutes before they were actually freed, allowing ICE agents to take them into custody before they left the building. And Penzone kept in place Maricopa County\u2019s long-standing policy of permitting ICE agents to enter its jails and to interview any people booked there to determine their immigration status. This rankled local immigration activist Jacinta Gonz\u00e1lez, who sued Arpaio and the Sheriff\u2019s Office in December 2016, after she was arrested during a March 2016 protest against then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s suit, which argues that she was unfairly held in jail overnight upon ICE\u2019s request, after a judge had ordered her release, appears to have at least partly prompted Penzone\u2019s decision to end courtesy holds. Although Gonz\u00e1lez said she was pleased that Penzone has recognized such detentions as unconstitutional, she described the policy now in place as \u201cone step forward, two steps back.\u201d To repair the department\u2019s relationship with the community effectively, Gonz\u00e1lez argued, Penzone needs \u201cto completely eradicate all of the unconstitutional behavior that was happening inside of his jail.\u201d As long as ICE agents are allowed inside the jail, she argued, that will not be possible. \u201cWhat we need from Sheriff Penzone is to make sure no one is being profiled or rights violated,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone who enters has to have a warrant. That includes ICE agents.\u201d On Tuesday  she amended her suit  to incorporate that demand. The ACLU of Arizona, which has spearheaded a number of major lawsuits against the Sheriff\u2019s Office and is tasked with monitoring the department\u2019s compliance with certain court orders, is also hopeful about Penzone\u2019s progress, with some caveats. \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Office is implementing reforms more slowly than we had expected and more slowly than the court ordered, and there continues to be agency-wide racial bias in traffic stops,\u201d said Kathy Brody, legal director for the ACLU of Arizona, in a statement to Yahoo News. \u201cWe are hopeful that Sheriff Penzone will take immediate action to address the continued problem of bias in his department and will accelerate his agency\u2019s compliance with court orders, which will help protect the rights of Latinos in Maricopa County.\u201d View photos Paul Penzone, who defeated Sheriff Joe Arpaio in the November election announced on Feb. 17, 2017, that he was ending a policy that keeps immigrants locked up in his jails past their release date, to give federal authorities extra time to launch deportation proceedings. (Photo: Ross D. Franklin, File/AP) More Penzone\u2019s decision to change the department\u2019s ICE detainer policy reflects the challenge that he faces in trying to get rid of the worst elements of Arpaio\u2019s legacy while federal policy is moving in the opposite direction and directives are being issued at the national level that, in some cases, seem to have been copied straight from his predecessor\u2019s playbook. Last month, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly  issued two memos  outlining a plan to implement President Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration. Provisions in those memos included a request for local and county law enforcement agencies to comply with ICE request for courtesy holds \u2014 the very practice that the Maricopa County attorney\u2019s office had just deemed unconstitutional. In a letter to Kelly, Penzone explained his predicament, noting that \u201c43 of the 50 states have counties that cannot enforce courtesy holds due to the illegality of the practice.\u201d In the memos, Kelly also called on ICE and U.S. Department of Customs and Border Protection to resume partnerships under the previously dismantled federal 287(g) program, which provides trained state and local law enforcement officers with the authority to identify and detain people believed to be in the country illegally. However, as Penzone pointed out in his letter to Kelly, Maricopa County was previously engaged in such a partnership, but had its  287(g) status revoked by the Department of Homeland S ecurity  in 2011. A three-year Justice Department investigation concluded, according to the Associated Press, that \u201cArpaio\u2019s office committed a wide range of civil rights violations against Latinos, including unjust immigration patrols and jail policies that deprive prisoners of basic constitutional rights.\u201d Two years later, federal Judge G. Murray Snow echoed the Justice Department\u2019s conclusions about the Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s use of racial profiling in the class-action lawsuit  Ortega Melendres v. Arpaio. In his comprehensive decision on the case, Snow stated that \u201cUntil December 2011, [when the agency lost its 287(g) status, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office] operated under the erroneous assumption that being an unauthorized alien in this country established a criminal violation of federal immigration law. \u2026 However, in the absence of additional facts, being in the country without authorization is not, in and of itself, a federal criminal offense.\u201d Penzone called on Kelly to provide clearer guidelines of how Homeland Security expects local law enforcement agencies to assist federal immigration enforcement efforts without overstepping legal boundaries. \u201cIt has always been my position we must be strong on issues of crime, including illegal immigration,\u201d he wrote. However, \u201cI will not violate the law or the constitution so the ends justify the means.\u201d Court orders and other legal ramifications of Arpaio\u2019s practices are just part of the mess inherited by Penzone. During the height of Arpaio\u2019s worksite immigration raids, between 2005 and 2007, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office neglected to investigate  hundreds of sex crimes , including many allegations of child molestation.  A 2008 report  by the conservative Goldwater institute found that under Arpaio\u2019s watch, \u201cviolent crime rates recently have soared, both in absolute terms and relative to other jurisdictions,\u201d noting a coinciding drop in arrest rates by Maricopa County sheriff\u2019s deputies and prolonged response times to 911 calls. (In addition to running the jails, the Sheriff\u2019s Office is the first responder in most of the county outside the city of Phoenix, which has its own police department.) \u201cA lot of the energy and a lot of the money and a lot of the focus of the agency was around advancing the previous sheriff\u2019s profile,\u201d said Casey, who joined Penzone\u2019s administration after 17 years at the local NBC News affiliate, where he covered the department under Arpaio. \u201cThat kind of got worse over time.\u201d View photos In this Nov. 8, 2016, file photo, Paul Penzone addresses supporters at an election party in Phoenix. (Photo: Matt York, File/AP) More \u201cThe sheriff is basically bringing basic principles of operation to the law enforcement agency, getting it focused on law enforcement,\u201d said Casey. This includes reassuring members of Maricopa County\u2019s immigrant and even undocumented populations that they, too, are entitled to police protection, as confusion and fear surrounding new federal enforcement policies have driven many into hiding. \u201cWe as an agency have a lot of baggage in this area,\u201d he\u00a0said, noting that the Sheriff\u2019s Office is choosing to handle this problem through outreach. \u201cThe way you police this is: You are visible and you\u2019re nonthreatening.\u201d But Gonz\u00e1lez questions the effectiveness of outreach, arguing that, \u201cAt the end of the day, the community knows what really matters is what happens inside of his jail.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if he has advisory committees if you know that if you\u2019re Latino, you\u2019re going to be profiled in that jail,\u201d she said. She pointedly noted that Penzone\u2019s victory owed much to the votes of Latinos and other immigrants. \u201cPenzone was elected on a platform of respect for everyone\u2019s human rights,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are really watching his leadership.\u201d At least some of the students at last week\u2019s journalism school gathering said they were pleasantly surprised to hear Penzone address some of these concerns. Emily Cervantes, a freshman at Mesa High School, in Mesa, Ariz., said that although her father has lived in the United States since he was 20 or so, \u201che hasn\u2019t got his working permit, so he\u2019s scared, and he\u2019s very stressed.\u201d The family of Cervantes\u2019 classmate Veronica Haumann is dealing with similar concerns. Her mother, who is a U.S. citizen, has begun driving her stepfather, who is not, to work every morning. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want him driving anymore,\u201d Haumann told Yahoo News, out of fear, she said, that he might be stopped, checked \u2014 and wind up in ICE custody. \u201cAnd then my baby brother would grow up without a dad.\u201d \u00a0", "description": "Paul Penzone, Democratic candidate for Maricopa County sheriff, speaks to supporters during an election night party, on Nov. 8, 2016, in Phoenix.

Delfin Lorenzana said the ships were seen last year near Benham Rise -- a Philippine territory 250 kilometres (155 miles) off the east coast of the main island of Luzon -- as well as Reed Bank in the South China Sea, which is claimed by both Manila and Beijing. \"I have ordered the navy that if they see this service ship this year, to start to accost them and drive them away\" from Benham Rise, Lorenzana said. \"The very concerning thing is they have several service ships plying this area, staying in one area sometimes for a month as if doing nothing. But we believe they are actually surveying the seabed,\" he told journalists. Lorenzana's statement comes as President Rodrigo Duterte seeks warmer relations with Beijing, after ties soured under the previous administration because of conflicting claims in the South China Sea. Asked why the ships might be surveying in Benham Rise, Lorenzana said he received information the vessels were \"looking for a place to put submarines\". Benham Rise is an underwater landmass believed to be potentially rich in mineral and natural gas deposits. In 2012, the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf approved the Philippines' undisputed territorial claim to Benham Rise. The Philippines and China, along with Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, have conflicting claims to the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the vital sealane, including the Reed Bank, which is about 148 kilometres (92 miles) off the Philippine island of Palawan and which Manila considers as its territory. Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino, had pressed the Philippines' claims leading to tensions with China. But Duterte, who took office last year, has focused on boosting relations with Beijing, downplaying the territorial conflict while seeking financial and military aid.", "description": "Chinese survey ships have been entering waters recognised by the United Nations as Philippine territory, Manila's defence secretary said Thursday, in a move he described as \"very concerning\".

Sumner Judicial Center in Dade City, Fla., Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017. A Florida judge is hearing evidence to determine whether Reeves acted in self-defense when he shot a man in a movie theater in 2014. (Charlie Kaijo /Tampa Bay Times via AP, Pool) More ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida judge on Friday denied a \"stand your ground\" defense for a retired Florida police officer who fatally shot a man in a movie theater over texting, which means the 74-year-old could stand trial on second-degree murder charges. Judge Susan Barthle ruled that Curtis is not immune from prosecution in the death of 43-year-old Chad Oulson. The shooting happened in a movie theater in a suburb north of Tampa in January 2014 after the two men got into an argument because Oulson was texting his daughter's day care during the movie previews. The two men and their wives were seated near each other during a showing of the movie \"Lone Survivor.\" Reeves is free on bond. Florida has been a leader in giving citizens immunity in cases of self-defense, with its stand-your-ground law serving as an emotional point of debate after several high-profile shooting deaths. That includes the death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. During a two-week hearing to determine whether Reeves would have to stand trial, Reeves testified he shot Oulson after he was either punched or hit in the face with a cellphone. \"I realized I was in a life-or-death struggle. He was no longer a loudmouth; he was a definite threat,\" Reeves said in court. \"He was reaching for me. ... He was getting ready to punch me. I perceived that. That's when the pistol came out.\" The judge said a videotape of the events captured that afternoon by a movie theater surveillance camera didn't support Reeves' testimony that he felt physically threatened. The video did show Oulson throwing popcorn at Reeves. An instant later, Reeves pulled a gun from his pocket and fired. Oulson was shot in the chest. Related: For more  news videos  visit  Yahoo View , available now on  iOS  and  Android . \"The physical evidence contradicts the defendant's version of events,\" the judge wrote in her ruling. She found that while Reeves testified he was hit in the outside corner of his left eye with a cellphone or a fist, \"common sense and the credible testimony of the medical examiner\" casts doubt that he was hit in the eye beneath his glasses. \"The logical conclusion is that he was trying to justify his actions after the fact,\" she said. Reeves also is charged with aggravated battery because the shot hit Oulson's wife in the finger. Dino Michaels, a Tampa lawyer who is a member of the defense team, said Friday that Reeves will appeal Judge Barthle's ruling. \"We respect the decision of the court,\" Michaels said. \"I don't think it's proper to comment on the court's order at this point, and we're taking the next step available for our client.\" The attorney for Nicole Oulson, T.J. Grimaldi, told The Associated Press on Friday that he and his client are \"thrilled\" with the judge's ruling. Grimaldi said they're prepared for a long delay; if the appeals court agrees with the lower court, Grimaldi said a trial probably wouldn't happen until next year. \"But this is without a doubt good news,\" Grimaldi said. \"In my opinion, this was the defense's only shot. I really feel this was a bastardization of the 'stand your ground' law. You cannot convince me that the legislature's intent was to pass a law that when someone throws popcorn on someone else, that person can shoot them.\" Richard Escobar, the attorney for Reeves, did not immediately return a call for comment. ___ Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush", "description": "ST.

Speaking before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Joe Votel said \"somewhere between four and 12 casualties\" resulted from the US raid, which was authorized by US President Donald Trump a few days after his inauguration. \"We have made a determination based on our best information available that we did cause casualties, somewhere between four and 12 casualties,\" which US forces \"accept responsibility for,\" he said. The investigation carried out after the raid did not establish \"incompetence,\" \"poor decision making,\" or \"bad judgment,\" he told the Senate hearing. The January 29 raid -- the first authorized by Trump -- saw US special operations forces enter the Yakla region of Baida province and target a compound occupied by Al-Qaeda in the Arabic Peninsula (AQAP) operatives. The mission was beset with problems and resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL as well as several non-combatants, including women and children. The US also lost a $75 million MV-22 Osprey aircraft. The White House rejected criticism of the operation, saying it would be an insult to the SEAL who was killed, William \"Ryan\" Owens. For several months the US has intensified airstrikes against AQAP, operations that appear to have increased since Trump came to power. At least 22 alleged AQAP fighters have been killed in these raids since March 2. Yemen's more than two years of civil war between government forces and Shiite rebels who control the capital have created a power vacuum, which AQAP has exploited to consolidate its presence in the south and east. The International Crisis Group think-tank has warned that operations like the Baida raid risk fanning hostility towards the United States among civilians, providing fertile ground for recruitment by Al-Qaeda.", "description": "Up to a dozen civilians died during a controversial January raid against Al Qaeda in Yemen, but an investigation did not uncover \"bad judgment\" during the operation, the head of US forces in the Middle East said.

But they might not have to wait much longer, according to the authoritative energy news site E&E News, which is reporting that the administration is preparing to set the repeal in motion with an executive order as early as next week. And there is no \u201c\u2026 and replace\u201d in the administration\u2019s reported plans, which also include instructing the Justice Department to stop defending the rule in a case before a federal appeals court. The intention, according to E&E, is to rescind the controversial regulation and replace it with \u2026 nothing. That approach is consistent with Trump\u2019s promises during the campaign to revive the coal industry, and with EPA chief Scott Pruitt\u2019s insistence that the science linking global warming to emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is uncertain. Pruitt said as much during his confirmation hearing in a  testy exchange with Sen. Bernie Sanders,  and again Thursday morning  on CNBC , where he cited \u201ctremendous disagreement about the degree of impact\u201d from human activity. As Sanders pointed out, the \u201cdisagreement\u201d on this question, as measured by peer-reviewed scientific publications, is actually a 97% consensus in favor of the view that global warming is a human artifact.  Each of the last three years has been, successively, the warmest on record. A January report by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded, \u201cThe planet\u2019s average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.\u201d Trump himself has not been especially worried about global temperature increases throughout the years. Before he became president, he frequently called for additional warming. \u201cIt\u2019s really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!\u201d he  tweeted in October of 2015 . The year before,  Trump quipped : \u201cIt\u2019s late in July and it is really cold outside in New York.

The 29-year-old\u00a0 90210  actress gave a harrowing interview to  the BBC  on Wednesday in honor of International Women\u2019s Day, where she  spoke again about her\u00a0assault  and what she\u2019s learned now that could help other survivors. Recounting the incident,\u00a0McCord noted how her rape happened in a different way than those often described by society. \u201cI was never raped in these scenarios they tell you you\u2019re going to get raped in,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in my own home. Let a friend come stay at my place because [he] needed to\u00a0crash. And I woke up to find my Southern hospitality, if you want to call it that, was being greatly taken advantage of. I woke up, and he was inside me \u2014 and my whole body shut down.\u201d At the time, McCord was just 18-years-old and living in Los Angeles where she was pursuing a career as an actress. Though she had grown up the pastor\u2019s daughter in a devoutly Christian household, she had also experienced strict discipline\u00a0from her parents as a child. Leaving home at 15, she admits to going \u201ca little crazy-wild in New York, dancing on tables wearing little miniskirts.\u201d Those things combined made her feel responsible for her own rape \u2014 though she admits now \u201chow I dress does not mean yes.\u201d \u201cFor 10 years I thought it was my fault,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cI didn\u2019t fight back. I found out recently through my studies of neuroscience that my body completely shut everything down and wouldn\u2019t let me fight back because I thought that was the only way to cope with abuse.\u201d\u00a0 AnnaLynne McCord Admits She Self-Harmed and Was \u2018Suicidal\u2019 After Being Raped By a Friend in Her Own Home More After the incident happened, McCord said she completely shut down. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one seeking any kind of solace or consolation from what happened \u2014 I\u00a0pretended like it didn\u2019t occur and went on with my life,\u201d she explained. \u201cI thought I was fine and continued \u2018living,\u2019 if you want to call that living.\u201d \u201cI became very, very dark,\u201d she added. \u201cSuicidal. Self-harming \u2013 cutting up my arms.\u201d But she also found herself drawn to charity work, especially\u00a0with survivors of the Cambodian sex trade. \u201cI fight human trafficking, working with survivors of consistent rape every day \u2014 all day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re working to get them back to some sort of normalcy.\u201d When she was asked by writers on\u00a0 90210 \u00a0 if she was comfortable playing a storyline in which her character Naomi\u00a0was raped by a teacher, McCord jumped at the chance thinking of her charity work \u2014 but\u00a0not realizing her own connection to the material. \u201cThe producers came down and asked, \u2018Would you want to portray this \u2014 it\u2019s very dark.\u2019 It was the story of my character being raped. And I was like, \u2018Yes, this is such an important topic,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt was something I was really excited to tackle.\u201d \u201cI did months and months of episodes,\u201d McCord continued. \u201cI was in to a second season of the storyline when I had a moment on set and what happened to me all came back in a flash.\u201d Since then, she hasn\u2019t looked back \u2014 first revealing her story in a May 2014\u00a0 Cosmopolitan  piece and since taking her message to college campuses with her short film,  I Choose.\u00a0 \u201cThe support has been amazing,\u201d  she previously told\u00a0PEOPLE . \u201cYou think in your head that the opposite is going to happen. You think that you\u2019ll be shamed and there will be even more degradation, humiliation. And the opposite has been apparent. But what\u2019s even more important than that to me has been the outreach from survivors who are telling me their stories.\u201d She said thousands victims have reach outed to her about their own experiences \u2014 emails that she personally takes the time to answer. \u201cEighty percent of them have told me for the very first time \u2013 a complete stranger, someone they don\u2019t even know, a random actress in Los Angeles \u2013 because I said, \u2018Hey, I was raped too and it\u2019s okay,\u2019 \u201d McCord shared. \u201cAnd the \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019 part is the most crucial part.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d is something McCord had to tell herself a lot in the wake of her revelation. But after years of dealing with self-worth and self-esteem issues, she said\u00a0she\u2019s finally at a place where she is happy with herself \u2014\u00a0and hopes\u00a0others who were victims of sexual assault also get on the long road to recovery. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to report that I love myself now, I think she\u2019s wonderful. But it\u2019s taken me a long time,\u201d\u00a0 McCord said . \u201cI\u2019m just very thankful that The Rape Foundation create an opportunity for survivors like myself to experience love \u2013 experience what I didn\u2019t have in silence for nine years before finally coming out about it.\u201d", "description": "The 29-year-old\u00a090210 actress gave a harrowing interview to the BBC on Wednesday in honor of International Women\u2019s Day, where she spoke again about her\u00a0assault and what she\u2019s learned now that could help other survivors.", "title": "AnnaLynne McCord Admits She Self-Harmed and Was \u2018Suicidal\u2019 After Being Raped By a Friend in Her Own Home"}

Jill Smokler, who started  Scary Mommy  in 2008, has announced that she and her husband, Jeff Smokler, are divorcing after 17 years of marriage. The couple, who have three kids together, also revealed that the catalyst for their split is the fact that Jeff is gay. But the revelation didn\u2019t come overnight. The pair, who are both 39 and live in Baltimore, Maryland, tells PEOPLE that their love for each other led them to keep Jeff\u2019s secret for more than\u00a0a decade. \u201cOver the last 15 years, we\u2019ve struggled with what we kept a secret from everybody else,\u201d Jeff says. \u201cAnd as non-conforming as I think our marriage was, I think our divorce is equally non-conforming.\u00a0We want to show folks that you can do divorce in a way that not just puts your children first, but can come from a place of love. And in our case, there has never been a shortage of love. \u201cIn sharing our truth, we hope to help other people.\u201d Jill adds, \u201cI signed on for this. It was our secret and we were in it together. I could have opted out before we had kids. I had that opportunity, but I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around this feeling that this was my person. I didn\u2019t want to walk away.\u201d Jeff and Jill met during their first week as freshmen\u00a0at Washington University in St. Louis. And they both knew from the start that they had met their match. \u201cJill and I are soul mates, and I knew that very early on,\u201d says Jeff. \u201cShe just completed me.\u201d Jill agrees, adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t have it in my head that I wanted to meet \u2018The\u00a0One\u2019 the first week of school. it was very clear that it wasn\u2019t going to be a casual relationship. It\u00a0was intense and consuming. I just felt like he was my person.\u201d After five years\u00a0of dating, the couple wed in 2000, and it wasn\u2019t until two\u00a0years into their marriage that Jeff started to understand (what he perceived at the time to be) his bisexuality. \u201cThe first person I talked about it with was Jill.\u00a0I really believe I was bisexual then, and it wasn\u2019t something that was all-consuming,\u201d Jeff says. \u201cBut over the years, my sexuality became much more a part of who I was.\u00a0For many years, Jill and I viewed it as a piece of me that we had to deal with, but I think we both silently knew over time that it was becoming a bigger piece of me.\u201d But what never changed over the years was Jeff\u2019s love for Jill. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing to me is how in love a gay man could be with a woman,\u201d Jeff says. \u201cI was in love with Jill as much as anybody could be in love with anybody. And for the first seven years of our relationship, that was enough, it truly was.\u201d \u00a0 The couple says they never swept their issue under the rug. They talked about it openly and honestly over the years and even saw a therapist. But they weren\u2019t ready to go public with their secret until now. \u201cI actually think that this evolved in the way that it should have, in a way where we thought the kids were at a point to be ready, we felt we were at a point where\u00a0we were ready, but I certainly don\u2019t have any regrets about marrying or staying married as long as we did,\u201d says Jill. But\u00a0what scared them the most was preparing to tell their three kids\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Lily 13, Ben, 11, and Evan 9 \u2014 which they did last Saturday. \u201cI was waiting for it to all come crumbling down once they knew, and I was terrified of their responses,\u201d Jill says. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to a therapist about the best way to address it\u00a0with them and we decided that just being honest is the best approach.\u201d The couple told their daughter first, with Jeff doing most of the talking. \u201cHer immediate response was to get up and give him a great big hug and tell him how much she loved him,\u201d Jill shares. \u201cIt was just such a compassionate and mature response.\u201d Jeff adds, \u201cWe told our sons immediately after and conveyed the same message to all three that the conversation isn\u2019t over. And that Mommy and Daddy are going to be happy now and happier people make better parents.\u201d Jeff now lives in a house three miles from the family home. The kids stay with him three nights a week and their daily routine has remained relatively unchanged. \u201cWe will still have family dinners. We will still go on family vacations. We will still be a family, it\u2019s just a different kind of family,\u201d says Jill. Adds Jeff, \u201cThey have their moments of sadness and being quiet but they also know that they can talk to us about anything.\u201d", "description": "Jill Smokler, who started Scary Mommy in 2008, has announced that she and her husband, Jeff Smokler, are divorcing after 17 years of marriage.

Two House of Representatives committees debated the draft legislation late into the night on Wednesday in marathon sessions, two days after it was unveiled by Republican leaders and endorsed by Trump. They made slow progress.

Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act and condemned by Republicans since its passage in 2010, enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage, about half through an expansion - which the new bill would end - of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor. Republican lawmakers face resistance from conservatives within their own ranks who say the bill, which would create a system of tax credits to coax people to buy private insurance on the open market, is not radical enough.

They are pointing a desperate finger at the innocence of our youth. Disney is targeting our youth like they\u2019re aiming at big game on a corporate hunting trip. They are banking on corrupting the purity of a child\u2019s mind for the 1%. They are no longer making watching a choice, but by forcing it to become mainstream, Disney is telling the conservative family, the Christian public, that they\u2019re views hold no worth. In jest, they\u2019re subtly encouraging you to conform your ways. (Mark 13:22)\" She went on to voice her concerns that Disney would eventually carry over its \"agenda\" from the film into its theme parks, something she says she simply couldn't support. Before long, the post went viral - and while some responded by agreeing with Poston, the majority were quick to express their outrage over her decision to cancel her trip and boycott Disney. In response,  The Huffington Post   reached out to the blogger for her response to the criticism she's received, and she offered a lengthy email, which can be read in full  here . There is no denying that the majority of reactions to my post have made me out to be a person filled with hate and disgust,\" she wrote. \"Even through this, my views have not changed.\" \"Know that whoever you are and however you identify, I have only compassion for you,\" she continued. \"We may not be fighting for the same things, we may not be fighting together, but know that we are each passionate for our own causes.

The court cleared 117 accused who were also facing charges of murder, arson and rioting after hundreds of workers clashed with managers over wages and appointments at the Maruti Suzuki factory in Manesar. The hearing in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New Delhi, found 13 workers guilty of murdering Awanish Kumar Dev, whose charred body was found in the remains of a building following the riots in July 2012. Dev, who was a human resources manager, died after he failed to escape a blaze which was started by workers who went on the rampage in Manesar, which is around two hours' drive southwest of the capital. The additional sessions court ruled that 18 others were guilty of rioting, arson and damaging property and will announce the sentences on March 17. A lawyer for those found guilty on Friday immediately announced plans to appeal against the convictions. \"We will challenge the conviction in a higher court,\" Monu Kuhar, part of the defence team, told AFP. - Protests threat - Hundreds of policemen in riot gear were deployed at the court and outside automakers offices' over threats by workers to mobilise large-scale protests if their colleagues \"did not get justice\". On Thursday, thousands of workers staged a brief work stoppage at Maruti and other auto companies' offices to express solidarity with the accused. Prosecutors told the court that the attack was the result of a conspiracy by workers, who were at loggerheads with the management over wages and plans to set up a union at the workplace. The plant, which manufactures nearly 700,000 cars annually, was shut for 60 days prior to the deadly violence. Investigators said more than a thousand workers had charged at the administration block and attacked the officials with iron rods and car parts such as axles at the plant. They beat up officers, including Dev, breaking his limbs leaving him immobile and leaving him unable to flee the flames. More than 100 other managers were injured in the day-long violence that shut the plant for over a month. But union leaders claim it was triggered by an argument between a supervisor and a casual employee, who was abused over his caste. Maruti Suzuki, a subsidiary of Japanese automobile major Suzuki, has a market share of 51 percent in India. Workplace violence is not uncommon in India, where workers are often locked in conflict with the management over wages and hostile working conditions, but it is rare for major corporates to be targeted. Labour unions frequently accuse management of hiring cheap labour through short-term contracts which makes it easier for firms to dismiss workers. Last year a court in Tamil Nadu sentenced eight workers to life imprisonment over the lynching of a senior manager in violence sparked by the dismissal of 42 workers at an automobile spare parts factory. In June 2014, around 200 workers bludgeoned to death the owner of a jute firm in West Bengal with iron rods and stones after the management of the loss-making company increased their working hours.", "description": "An Indian court convicted 31 workers Friday over an outburst of deadly violence at a car plant in 2012, including 13 for murder, during one of the country's worst episodes of labour unrest.

(Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool Image via AP)  More MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from enforcing his new travel ban against a Syrian family looking to escape their war-torn homeland by fleeing to Wisconsin. The ruling likely is the first by a judge since Trump issued a revised travel ban on Monday, according to a spokesman for the Washington state attorney general, who has led states challenging the ban. A Syrian Muslim man who was granted asylum and settled in Wisconsin has been working since last year to win U.S. government approval for his wife and 3-year-old daughter to leave the devastated city of Aleppo and join him here. The man, who is not identified because of fears for his family's safety, filed a federal lawsuit in Madison in February alleging Trump's first travel ban had wrongly stopped the visa process for his family. U.S. District Judge William Conley set that challenge aside after a federal judge in Washington state blocked the entire Trump travel order. Trump signed a new executive order on Monday. The Syrian man filed a new complaint on Friday afternoon, alleging the new order is still an anti-Muslim ban that violates his freedom of religion and right to due process. He asked Conley to block its enforcement against his family. Judge Conley granted that request, saying there were daily threats to the Syrian man's wife and child that could cause \"irreparable harm.\" He issued a temporary restraining order barring enforcement against the family. The order doesn't block the entire travel ban. It simply prevents Trump's administration from enforcing it against this family pending a March 21 hearing. After the Trump ban was blocked the first time, the approval process restarted for the Syrian family and they're now preparing to travel to Jordan for visa interviews at the U.S. embassy, the last step before U.S. customs officials decide whether to issue them visas. But the family doesn't have dates for the interviews yet and Trump's new travel ban goes into effect March 16, stirring fears that the process could halt again before visas are issued, according to the Syrian man's attorneys. Government attorneys argued during a teleconference with Conley on Friday that the new ban may not apply to this family anyway, although they did not go into details. There are various exemptions and waivers in the new ban including some that give consular officers flexibility to decide cases. Conley acknowledged that the family's situation is murky but still issued the order, saying the man seems to have a good chance of winning the case. The U.S. Justice Department is defending the ban. Spokeswoman Nicole Navas said agency attorneys were reviewing the Syrian man's complaint and declined further comment on it and Conley's order. Trump issued an executive order in January banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria, from entering the United States. U.S. District Judge James Robart in Washington state blocked the entire order on Feb. 3. The revised order issued Monday removed Iraq from the list of countries and would temporarily shuts down the refugee program. Unlike the first order, the new ban would not affect current visa holders and removes language that would give priority to religious minorities. Hawaii filed a lawsuit challenging the new ban Wednesday; other states with Democratic attorneys general plan to sue next week. According to the Syrian man's lawsuit, he fled his country to avoid near-certain death at the hands of two military factions, one a Sunni-aligned group fighting against President Bashar al-Assad's regime and another group fighting in support of Assad. The pro-Assad forces thought he was sympathetic to the other side and the anti-Assad army targeted him because he was a Sunni and traveled to pro-Assad areas to manage his family's business. Both sides tortured him and threatened to kill him, the lawsuit said. The pro-Assad forces also threatened to rape his wife. He came to the United States in 2014 and was granted asylum last year. He then began filing petitions seeking asylum for his wife and daughter. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Judge Conley's first name is 'William' not 'Michael.' ___ Follow Todd Richmond on Twitter at https://twitter.com/trichmond1", "description": "A federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from enforcing his new travel ban against a Syrian family looking to escape their war-torn homeland by fleeing to Wisconsin.

{"url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-travel-ban-impacts-air-travel-threatens-us-tourism-192420197.html", "content": "On March 6, President Donald Trump signed an  executive order revising  the controversial travel ban he issued on Jan. 27 that banned refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. The new order scales back some of the original language and restrictions, but in certain industries, the fallout could take longer to recover. At the ITB travel fair in Berlin on Thursday, Emirates President Tim Clark revealed that the airline has seen booking rates on US flights  fall by 35% since the initial ban.  \u201cI am concerned. It\u2019s the tone of it. We have brought millions of Muslims to the United States, but now they may not feel welcome, they may look at going on holiday elsewhere,\u201d  he said .  Competitor airline Qatar Airways said it has not experienced a drop in bookings for US flights. According to the US Travel Association, more than 77 million people from abroad visited the US in 2015, with 38.4 million coming from overseas markets  (excluding Canada and Mexico) . But following January\u2019s ban, the airline industry took a hit, with Hopper  reporting  that flight searches dropped as much as 17% after the original announcement. Jonathan Grella, the executive VP of public affairs at the US Travel Association, says the administration did some good in revising the ban, but suggests that a simple gesture could do a lot to quell international uncertainty.  \u201cThe administration didn\u2019t follow through with a balancing message including an overt welcome to legitimate travelers,\u201d Grella told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe have to put our best foot forward to make sure people around the world don\u2019t get the wrong impression, or we\u2019ll find ourselves with two problems\u201d \u2014 a negative impact on security and prosperity. Indeed, a sharp decrease in international travel could have a negative impact on the US economy. Currently, one out of nine jobs in the US depends on travel and tourism, and those workers earn more than $231.6 billion every year. In the first six months of 2016, international visitors spent nearly $125 billion on tourism related goods, and that spending directly supported 1.1 million jobs in the US,  according to the US Travel Association.  Simply put, bringing people into the US who spend money without needing our government services, like education or healthcare, is a great way to grow the economy and create jobs. Echoing the stats from Hopper, Forward Keys, a travel tracking site,  also found  that international arrivals have continued to suffer after the Jan. 27 ban. On Feb. 17, when Trump announced that a revised executive order would be introduced, bookings from the seven countries in consideration fell 7% by Feb. 25. More alarmingly, bookings from other countries not mentioned in the ban also fell 4%. It\u2019s this stat that concerns Grella. \u00a0 \u201cTo think that only the countries upset are the ones mentioned in the ban is to misunderstand the moment,\u201d said Grella. \u201cUndecided travelers are always making up their minds to stay home or head to a destination, and we shouldn\u2019t give them a reason not to come.\u201d Grella adds that Trump\u2019s \u201chospitality DNA\u201d and career as a businessman make him uniquely positioned to understand the economic impact travel has on the US economy. \u201cThe administration might want to think about a comprehensive marketing campaign to welcome legitimate travelers to the US,\u201d he said.  The revised executive order \u2013 which removes  Iraq  from the list of countries \u2013 will go into effect on March 16. The remaining six countries still include Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The revised order also exempts permanent residents and current visa holders and reversed the indefinite ban on refugees from Syria, opting instead for a 120-day free which will have to be reviewed and renewed.

{"url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/everything-know-dutch-election-201504287--abc-news-topstories.html", "content": "Everything you need to know about the Dutch election (ABC News) More Europe is preparing for a series of elections across the continent in the coming months that could determine the future of the European Union amid rising anti-establishment movements. The first of these will take place in the Netherlands next week as Dutch voters elect a new parliament and their next prime minister. Among the candidates is one that has been called the Dutch Donald Trump and is perhaps one of the most notable populist leaders in Europe at the moment. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Dutch election. Who are the main players? Geert Wilders The populist leader\u2019s Party for Freedom (PVV) began as a fringe party but is now one of the most formidable forces in this election, challenging more established parties with its anti-EU, anti-Islam platform. Wilders' populist appeal has elicited frequent comparisons to Trump. Wilders has campaigned on a platform that calls for banning immigration from Muslim countries, shutting down mosques and removing the Netherlands from the EU. The far-right leader was found guilty of inciting discrimination against Moroccans in the Netherlands last year and recently made headlines for calling Moroccans \"scum who make the streets unsafe.\" Mark Rutte The current prime minister is seeking his third term in office along with his Liberal (VVD) Party, which is currently governing in a coalition with the Labor Party (PvdA). During his time in office, Rutte has had to fend off growing criticism from populist quarters, led primarily by Wilders. These criticisms have grown particularly pronounced in the wake of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. In response, Rutte has moved to the right during the campaign. In January, the prime minister published an open letter to the country\u2019s citizens saying that anyone who refused to adapt to Dutch traditions should either \"behave normally or go away.\" When is the vote? Dutch voters will go to the polls on Wednesday, March 15. The results of the election will determine which party will have a chance to form a new government. What are the biggest issues? Immigration and Dutch EU membership are two of the biggest issues in this political campaign. Wilders has highlighted both and made a point of tying them to questions of Dutch identity. Rutte has jumped on the bandwagon with his appeal to integration but has also made a point of highlighting the ongoing recovery of the Dutch economy, which has seen unemployment drop to a five-year low, with 2.5 percent economic growth. How does the voting system work? While only a few parties really have a chance of winning enough votes to form a government, Dutch voters are actually choosing between 28 different parties in this election. This matters because parliament\u2019s make-up is determined by the proportion of votes received by each party. There are 150 seats up for grabs; if one single party received more than 50 percent of the vote that party ould instantly have enough seats to run its own government. But, because that rarely happens, parties typically have to form coalitions with other parties. The current government is a coalition of Rutte\u2019s VVD with the Labor Party (PvdA). Who is expected to win? Polls have consistently shown Wilder\u2019s PVV marginally ahead of Rutte\u2019s VVD but that lead has narrowed as the election has drawn closer. However, even if the PVV got the most votes, the party is not expected to be able to find allies in parliament willing to build a coalition government. Most parties have already voiced their opposition to working with the PVV, in which case the VVD will be tasked with forming a coalition. Why are ballots being counted by hand? In February, Dutch officials said they would count all ballots by hand over fears of cyber-hacking of election software. Allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election have raised concerns about the vulnerability of computer software and whether elections could be manipulated by outside actors. \u201cI cannot rule out that state actors may try to benefit from influencing political decisions and public opinion in the Netherlands,\u201d interior minister Ronald Plasterk said in a letter to parliament last month. Why are these elections significant? As the first in a series of European elections that will test the political viability of far-right, populist parties, the Dutch election is seen as a crucial bellwether. Regardless of whether Wilders is actually able to become the prime minister, he has already succeeded in shaping the public discourse around issues like immigration and the Netherlands\u2019 EU membership. Even as an opposition party, Wilders can guarantee that these issues remain at the forefront of Dutch politics.", "description": "Europe is preparing for a series of elections across the continent in the coming months that could determine the future of the European Union amid rising anti-establishment movements.

Giving employers such power is now prohibited by legislation including the 2008 genetic privacy and nondiscrimination law known as GINA. The new bill gets around that landmark law by stating explicitly that GINA and other protections do not apply when genetic tests are part of a \u201cworkplace wellness\u201d program. The bill was approved by a House committee on Wednesday, with all 22 Republicans supporting it and all 17 Democrats opposed. It has been overshadowed by the debate over the House GOP proposal\u00a0to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but the genetic testing bill is\u00a0expected to folded into a second ACA-related measure containing a grab-bag of provisions that do not affect federal spending, as the main bill does. \u201cWhat this bill would do is completely take away the protections of existing\u00a0laws,\u201d said Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, a civil rights group. In particular, privacy and other protections for genetic and health information in GINA and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act \u201cwould be pretty much eviscerated,\u201d she said. Employers say they need the changes because those two landmark laws are \u201cnot aligned in a consistent manner\u201d with laws about workplace wellness programs, as an employer group said in congressional testimony last week. Read more:   Top wellness award goes to workplace where many health measures got worse Employers got virtually everything they wanted for their workplace wellness programs during the Obama administration. The ACA allowed them to charge employees 50 percent more for health insurance if they declined to participate in the \u201cvoluntary\u201d programs, which typically include cholesterol and other screenings; health questionnaires that ask about personal habits including plans to get pregnant; and sometimes weight loss and smoking cessation classes. And in rules that Obama\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued last year, a workplace wellness program counts as \u201cvoluntary\u201d even if workers have to pay thousands of dollars more in premiums and deductibles if they don\u2019t participate. Despite those wins, the business community chafed at what it saw as the last obstacles to unfettered implementation of wellness programs: the genetic information and the disabilities laws. Both measures, according to congressional testimony last week by the American Benefits Council, \u201cput at risk the availability and effectiveness of workplace wellness programs,\u201d depriving employees of benefits like \u201cimproved health and productivity.\u201d The Council represents Fortune 500 companies and other large employers that provide employee benefits. It did not immediately respond to questions about how lack of access to genetic information hampers wellness programs. Rigorous studies by researchers not tied to the $8 billion wellness industry have shown that the programs improve employee health little if at all. An industry group recently concluded that they save so little on medical costs that, on average, the programs  lose money . But employers continue to embrace them, partly as a way to shift more health care costs to workers, including by  penalizing them financially . Read more:   Do workplace wellness programs improve employees\u2019 health? The 2008 genetic law prohibits a group health plan \u2014 the kind employers have \u2014 from asking, let alone requiring, someone to undergo a genetic test. It also prohibits that specifically for \u201cunderwriting purposes,\u201d which is where wellness programs come in. \u201cUnderwriting purposes\u201d includes basing insurance deductibles, rebates, rewards, or other financial incentives on completing a health risk assessment or health screenings. In addition, any\u00a0genetic information can\u00a0be provided to the employer only in a de-identified, aggregated form, rather than in a way that reveals which individual has which genetic profile. There is a big exception, however: as long as employers make\u00a0providing genetic information \u201cvoluntary,\u201d they\u00a0can ask employees for it. \u00a0Under the House bill, none of the protections for health and genetic information provided by GINA or the disabilities law\u00a0would apply to workplace wellness programs. As a result, employers could demand that employers undergo genetic testing and health screenings. While the information returned to employers would not include workers\u2019 names, it\u2019s not difficult, especially in a small company, to match a genetic profile with the individual. That \u201cwould undermine fundamentally the privacy provisions\u201d of those laws,\u201d said Nancy Cox, president of the American Society of Human Genetics, in a letter to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce the day before it approved the bill. \u201cIt would allow employers to ask employees invasive questions about \u2026 genetic tests they and their families have undergone\u201d and \u201cto impose stiff financial penalties on employees who choose to keep such information private, thus empowering employers to coerce their employees\u201d into providing their genetic information. If an employer has a wellness program but does not sponsor health insurance, rather than increasing insurance premiums, the employer could dock the paychecks of workers who don\u2019t participate. The privacy concerns also arise from how workplace wellness programs work. Employers, especially large ones, generally hire outside companies to run them. These companies are largely unregulated, and they are allowed to see genetic test results with employee names. They sometimes sell the health information they collect from employees.

Criticism was swift Thursday for some news and entertainment outlets from outraged social media users, including some on Twitter who responded to the Time Inc. tweet: \"Amal Clooney shows off her baby bump at the United Nations.\" The tweet linked to a story that ran on Time's Motto website, which is focused on younger women. The story's headline also referenced a \"baby bump\" but was changed, a spokeswoman for Time confirmed Friday. She declined further comment. The Mirror in London went with: \"Amal Clooney is a vision in yellow as she shows off hint of baby bump in chic dress,\" while E! News ran: \"Amal Clooney Shows Baby Bump in What Could Be the Ultimate International Women's Day Poster,\" all according to a story in the Washington Post questioning the approach in context to her speech. Among the critics was Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who has slammed media in the past for focusing on her \"childless\" status. In response to the Clooney bump tweet, Sturgeon wrote: \"I'm pretty certain that this wasn't the purpose of this impressive human rights lawyer's appearance at the UN.\" Clooney became an international celebrity after her union with Oscar-winner George Clooney. They married in 2014 and are now expecting twins. At the U.N., she urged Iraq and the world not to let the Islamic State \"get away with genocide.\" She expressed frustration that nothing has happened since she came to the U.N. six months ago seeking accountability for IS victims. Amal Clooney represents Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman captured by IS in Iraq in 2014. Murad has spoken out since her release about being raped and sold as a sex slave and is now a U.N. goodwill ambassador. Murad accompanied her to the U.N. and told the meeting that victims have been waiting more than a year for an investigation of IS to start.

It seems to us to be a clear situation in which he\u2019s using his office of the president to get a financial gain at the expense of local businesses.'\u201d Alan Garten, a Trump Organization lawyer, called the lawsuit \u201ca wild publicity stunt completely lacking in legal merit,\u201d  according to NBC News . THE EVOLUTION OF GAG RULE POLITICS. One of the two Wednesday protests in Washington on International Women\u2019s Day involved an array of speakers pushing back against one of Trump\u2019s earliest\u00a0presidential memoranda, which banned U.S. funding for any foreign organization that even talks about abortion services. This so-called global gag rule is an expansion of the one that has been U.S. policy off and on since 1984. As Michelle Goldberg  noted in Slate  after Trump signed the executive order, the administration\u2019s new version of the rule represents a massive expansion from earlier versions: \u201cIn the past, the global gag rule meant that foreign NGOs must disavow any involvement with abortion in order to receive U.S. family planning funding. Trump\u2019s version of the global gag rule expands the policy to all global health funding. According to [reproductive health organization PAI\u2019s Suzanne] Ehlers, the new rule means that rather than impacting $600 million in U.S. foreign aid, the global gag rule will affect $9.5 billion.\u201d And yet at the rally, the speakers seemed surprisingly optimistic that the rule could be repealed. I asked Serra Sipple, president of Change Global Center for Health Equity, the lead sponsor of the protest, about it after the rally concluded in Lafayette Park. The level of pushback against the rule this year is as novel as the extent of the measure itself, she said. \u201cOn the global gag rule, the Congress does have the power to repeal it. And I think already we have some 200 members of the House and Senate who have signed onto bills [to repeal it] \u2014 they signed on, like, two days after the global gag rule was reinstated \u2014 and that\u2019s unprecedented. We have, one, we have data. We have evidence today that we didn\u2019t have during the Bush years, during the Bush global gag rule \u2026 that it\u2019s failed, that it harms,\u201d said Sipple. \u201cSo that\u2019s different and new in what we have here. And our global health programs have changed, frankly. So when the presidential memorandum came out that said it was going to expand to global health programs, I mean, that\u2019s huge, because we have integrated health services on the ground. So it\u2019s not like family planning can be separated out from HIV or maternal health or even malaria. So now we have global health organizations that are really concerned and are also going to fight back. So we have evidence and we have a broader base of support from global health organizations that are going to fight this, so we have a stronger army this time around. So I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d The protest was co-sponsored by more than 40 other groups, from the National LGBTQ Task Force to the National Abortion Rights Action League. WHY THEY STRUCK.  The other big International Women\u2019s Day protest in D.C. was sponsored by  Eve Ensler\u2019s One Billion Rising group  and focused on the needs and concerns of low-wage women. Starting with a protest outside the U.S. Department of Labor, it continued with a rally in John Marshall Park on Constitution Avenue that mixed speeches, music and spoken word performance. I asked some of the women there if they were striking, and why. This is what they said: View photos Lisa Marie Thalhammer, 35, is a D.C.-based artist who joined the One Billion Rising protest on International Women\u2019s Day.

We need to show up for each other.\u201d \u2014 Deborah Press A LOSS FOR BLACK LIVES MATTER IN ST. LOUIS.  The Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t start in Ferguson, Mo., but the situation there put the region\u2019s\u00a0problems in the national spotlight. Translating that activism in the Ferguson-St. Louis area into electoral change has been slow going, however, and in Tuesday\u2019s St. Louis Democratic mayoral primary, it was dealt a setback. \u201cIf there was a nexus between the Black Lives Matter movement and the pussy-hat-wearing, International Day of Women post-Trump-election movement, it should have been the St. Louis Democratic primary for mayor on Tuesday,\u201d  reports the Root . \u201cSt. Louis has never had a female mayor, and the top two candidates were Lyda Krewson, a 64-year-old white alderman with the endorsement of the problematic St. Louis Police Department, and Tishaura Jones, a 44-year-old black incumbent city treasurer active with Black Lives Matter since the Ferguson, Mo., uprising. In a city that is majority black, somehow Jones lost to Krewson by a mere 888 votes (30.4 percent to 32 percent), less than a city block. Her loss shines the light on how sexism, racism and incompetence by black political leadership continue to stymie black progress even in this age of \u2018resistance.'\u201d If any of the trailing male candidates in the race had dropped out, it might have helped Jones consolidate the black vote, the Root reports: \u201cWhen Jones, whose prominence as St. Louis city treasurer skyrocketed because of her outspoken activism post-Ferguson, jumped into the race, conventional wisdom said that the top four black candidates would cancel one another out, allowing Krewson to win. As Jones gained in the polls, especially after ethering the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for systematic racism, and once she got the powerful endorsement of former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, one of the other black candidates, all of them men, needed to go. It was the only chance for St. Louis\u2019 black residents to finally get progressive representation. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA.  The states of Washington and New York are joining the legal battle against the new iteration of Trump\u2019s travel ban. \u201cWashington Attorney General Robert Ferguson will ask a Seattle federal judge to impose a temporary ban on President Donald Trump\u2019s latest executive order barring citizens of six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. starting March 16,\u201d  reports Bloomberg News . \u201cNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, another Democrat, announced in a statement that he will join Ferguson\u2019s lawsuit against the new travel ban.\u201d", "description": "D.C.

While McConnell said he is in favor of \u201cborder security,\u201d the Kentucky Republican also suggested that in some places, a border wall \u201cis probably not the best way to secure the border.\u201d Trump has said that due to natural barriers, his wall project would not need to be continuous. Lawmakers in border states have said that a physical wall is not enough to secure the border \u2014 and that a combination of fencing, technology and patrol officers are needed in many areas. Trump has repeatedly vowed that Mexico would pay for his proposed wall, despite public refusals by Mexican officials. In January, Trump said that the wall would initially be funded by U.S. taxpayers \u201cfor the sake of speed\u201d and that the country would be reimbursed by Mexico at a later date.

To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\u201d Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that \u201cillegal border crossings\u201d \u2014 defined as crossings made by people who were detained or rejected at the border \u2014 fell by nearly 40 percent from January to February compared to the same period last year. \u201cThe early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement. At the breakfast, McConnell praised Kelly\u2019s leadership. \u201cI think Gen.

The Office of Management Budget\u2019s (OMB) proposal calls for an increase in the Department of Homeland Security budget by 6.4 percent. The Washington Post reported that the draft proposal said \u201c\u201cthe Budget aggressively implements the President\u2019s commitment to construct a physical wall along the southern border.\u201d However, cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency which responds in the wake of natural disasters, Transportation Security Agency in charge of airport security, and the country\u2019s primary maritime security agency, the US Coast Guard, are outlined in the draft. The Coast Guard\u2019s $9.1 billion budget could be cut by 14 percent, making it the organization facing the largest cuts in the plan. The Pentagon\u2019s former Assistant Secretary for Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Todd A. Weiler told The Independent that if the cuts to the Coast Guard were approved by Congress, the effects would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter, representing California in the House of Representatives, wrote a letter to the head of the OMB that such a large proposed cut to Coast Guard budget would \u201cstand in dramatic contrast to the President\u2019s stated goals of securing our border.\u201d The Coast Guard plays an important role in law enforcement of drug traffickers as Mr Weiler pointed out that the country does not just have land borders. It also caught more than 6000 undocumented immigrants before they entered the country, another priority of the Trump administration. Mr Weiler offered one possible explanation for the OMB\u2019s \u201cdraconian\u201d cost-cutting measures to the Coast Guard: their role in enforcing environmental laws in US waters, like protecting endangered ocean species, preventing the illegal dumping of harmful chemicals, stopping oil spills, and stemming invasive species. \u201cMaybe someone got into [Mr Trump\u2019s] ear about that\u2026[environmental protection] is certainly not a priority for this administration,\u201d said Mr Weiler. The plan would put \u201crun ships harder and aircrafts longer\u201d without money or manpower for proper maintainence, according to Mr Weiler. From a security standpoint, he said this \u201cnegatively affects operational readiness and accident rates.\u201d The plan\u2019s cuts to the TSA and FEMA are less severe but would impact monitoring of train stations and other transportation hubs for potential terror attacks as well as state grants for emergency preparedness. Mr Weiler called the proposal\u2019s reduction in spending coupled with the White House\u2019s continued message of keeping security at the top of the national agenda, \u201cstereotypical of the way things are done in Washington.\u201d He explained that the problem is the \u201cdo more with less\u201d attitude puts people in harm\u2019s way and makes the agencies less effective, especially in the case of the Coast Guard\u2019s law enforcement operations.", "description": "President Trump has proposed slashing the budget of several national security-focused organizations in an effort to fund a border wall with Mexico.", "title": "Coast Guard will be 'devastated' by cost-cutting to pay for Donald Trump's Mexico wall"}

Until recently, Mensch\u2019s conspiracy-minded tweets about dark\u00a0Russian and American plots didn\u2019t get much attention.\u00a0\u00a0But all that changed after President Trump charged in his own\u00a0Saturday\u00a0morning Twitter storm that President Barack Obama had wiretapped his phone, an explosive allegation that\u00a0appears to trace back\u00a0to a four-month old story by Mensch in\u00a0 Heat Street , a libertarian-oriented website site owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. On\u00a0Nov. 7, the day before the presidential election, Mensch wrote that the FBI\u00a0had obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to monitor the \u201cactivities of \u2018U.S. persons\u2019 in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign with ties to Russia.\u201d\u00a0No American news organization has corroborated the account, but the day after Trump\u2019s\u00a0Saturday\u00a0tweets, Heat Street\u00a0 was quick to take credit as Trump\u2019s source \u00a0\u2014even if the goal of her reporting (to expose the president\u2019s purported ties to the Kremlin) was radically different from what the chief executive had in mind. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of my breaking that story,\u201d Mensch, 45, said in an interview with Yahoo News. \u201cWhat I put into play there is that there was a FISA warrant, and that the FBI clearly considered Donald Trump an agent of influence of a foreign power.\u201d The new spotlight on Mensch injects another colorful, if improbable, character into the Trump-Russia saga \u2014 a high-octane Oxford-educated former Tory politician turned journalist who has authored a string of \u201cchick lit\u201d novels for young women and is married to the manager of the rock bands Metallica and Red Hot Chili Peppers. \u201cLouise is a fireball,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a chief organizer of the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, who worked closely with her during the presidential campaign of the conservative independent candidate Evan McMullin. \u201cShe will run down stuff that other people have dismissed and\u00a0track down sources that others won\u2019t. She\u2019s absolutely a bulldog on this stuff. God love her.\u201d But Mensch\u2019s prominence has\u00a0raised multiple questions in the journalistic community, starting with: How could Mensch,\u00a0who\u00a0currently lives in New York and works as a vice president for creative and strategy for News Corp,\u00a0have possibly penetrated the supersecret world of FISA counterintelligence warrants, when no American reporter has been able to? And, perhaps more basically, should her vaguely sourced\u00a0account be believed? As New York Times legal affairs correspondent Charlie Savage wrote\u00a0Monday, \u201cthere are reasons to be skeptical.\u201d Without mentioning Mensch by name, he\u00a0 noted \u00a0that Heat Street \u201cdoes not regularly publish investigative stories about American intelligence or law enforcement operations. To date, reporters for The New York Times with demonstrated sources in that world have been unable to corroborate that the court issued any such order.\u201d Still, the line connecting Mensch\u2019s reporting and Trump\u2019s tweets, while somewhat attenuated, is\u00a0unmistakable. A\u00a0 Breitbart news story and\u00a0timeline  published last Friday, which was\u00a0reportedly widely circulated by White House officials\u00a0and given to the president, cites some of the same details that first appeared under Mensch\u2019s byline.\u00a0This includes her\u00a0claim that the FBI had made an earlier request in June to conduct surveillance on Trump associates that was turned down by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that must approve such warrants. Mensch, for her part, said, \u201cI stand by every word of my reporting.\u201d But,\u00a0she repeatedly emphasized, her own account of the FISA warrant \u2014 for which she cited two anonymous sources \u201cwith links to the counterintelligence community\u201d \u2014 is\u00a0more limited than the version of events tweeted by the president. Unlike Trump, Mensch made no mention of Obama playing a direct role in the FISA warrant. She also made no mention of any wiretaps targeting Trump Tower \u2014 a claim that Mensch suggested is implausible on its face, given that, as the Republican presidential candidate at the time, Trump\u2019s office would have been protected by the Secret Service. Mensch is trying to correct the record on what she did and did not write:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere seems to be a coordinated effort to rubbish my reporting by putting [in] stuff that\u2019s not there,\u201d she said. While she reported the existence of a FISA warrant, \u201cI could not possibly have had any idea what the FBI would do with the warrant. \u2026 I don\u2019t sensationally report. I don\u2019t report things I don\u2019t know to be true.\u201d Mensch refuses to say whether her two sources are current or former members of the \u201ccounterintelligence community\u201d or whether they are American or foreign. She does note that, while no U.S. news organization\u00a0has independently confirmed her account, two other British\u00a0media organizations, the\u00a0 Guardian \u00a0and the\u00a0 BBC , have followed\u00a0up with their own stories about the supposed warrant. Given that it was a\u00a0former British MI-6 spy, Christopher Steele,\u00a0who compiled the explosive, mostly\u00a0uncorroborated dossier\u00a0on the connections between Trump and Russian officials,\u00a0there has\u00a0been speculation about the\u00a0role of the British intelligence community in fueling the Russia scandal. One\u00a0reason for skepticism, her critics charge, is Mensch\u2019s penchant for conspiracy theories. One recent blog posting, entitled\u00a0 \u201cThe Carolina Conspiracy, \u00a0Or How Vladimir Putin Catifished a US Election With the Collusion of Team Trump,\u201d suggested that Kremlin trolls had deployed a criminal hacker to pose as a teenage North Carolina\u00a0girl \u201csexting\u201d with\u00a0former New York congressman Anthony Weiner \u2014 prompting the FBI investigation that ultimately led\u00a0FBI Director James Comey\u00a0to reopen\u00a0the Clinton email investigation on the eve of the November election. Mensch said she has a \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d to support her claims and will be publishing more on the subject shortly. It will show, she says, that a \u201cfake crime\u201d was created so that \u201ccorrupt FBI agents could seize Weiner\u2019s laptop,\u201d\u00a0which he shared with his wife, Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s closest aide. Then there is Mensch\u2019s tweet that Putin had Andrew Breitbart assassinated. The purported purpose of the murder, she has suggested, was to allow Steve Bannon to take over the alt-right website in order to better serve the Kremlin\u2019s interests. Mensch cites no source at all for the claim, but made a sharp distinction between her tweets on the subject \u2014 which were merely her opinion, she says, and her reported story on the FISA warrant. All this might lead to some, in a final bit of irony, to compare the conspiracy-minded tweeting of Mensch, an arch Trump critic, with the conspiracy-minded tweets of the president himself. It\u2019s a parallel that Mensch, wittingly or not, may only reinforce. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I believe,\u201d she said, when asked about her theory that Putin murdered Breitbart. \u201cI don\u2019t really believe in coincidences.\u201d \u00a0", "description": "Louise Mensch takes part in a debate at the Cambridge Union in 2015.

You don\u2019t have to pay $1,500 to get a washer that cleans well. Expensive washers offer a jumbo capacity and extra features, but if you don\u2019t need to wash 26 pounds of laundry in one load and using your phone to check your laundry\u2019s progress from Starbucks isn\u2019t a priority, then take a look at these washers from Consumer Reports\u2019 tests. They get the job done and cost $800 or less. High-Efficiency Top-Loaders Compared to agitator washers, HE top-loaders typically clean better, use less water, and spin at higher speeds so more water is extracted and dryer time is shortened. But the high-speed spin can tangle and wrinkle clothing and normal wash time using the heavy-soil setting is usually 60 to 80 minutes. Save time by using the normal wash on normal-soil setting. It\u2019s also known as the medium-soil or mid-soil setting. Consider: \u00a0 LG WT7500CW , $800,\u00a0 Kenmore 28132 , $700,\u00a0 Kenmore 26132 , $550,\u00a0 Kenmore 27132 , $600,  LG WT5480CW , $600,\u00a0 Kenmore 29132 , $800,\u00a0 Maytag Bravos MVWB835DW , $800,\u00a0and the  LG WT5270CW , $720. They have large capacities, were impressive at cleaning, and most are relatively quiet as you\u2019ll see in our  washing machine ratings . But like most top-loaders they weren't so gentle on fabrics. Check our\u00a0 washing machine ratings\u00a0 for\u00a0other models under $800 to consider.\u00a0 Tip:  Your laundry will tangle less if you wash similar items together rather than dump everything into the machine at once. Add a few items at a time and unbunch sleeves, pant legs, and socks. Shake them out before you put them in the dryer, and if you're not sure an HE top-loader is for you, read \" 5 Reasons to Buy an HE Top-Loader .\" Front-Loaders The best we tested clean better than most of the top-scoring HE top-loaders and use less water. Most front-loaders are gentle on fabrics, and relatively quiet. The  washing machine ratings  offer the details. Wash times range from 70 to 110 minutes using the heavy-soil setting, so use the normal-soil setting to save time.\u00a0Front-loaders spin even faster than HE top-loaders, usually extracting more water and reducing dryer time. For all their advantages, front-loaders have their drawbacks, like every washer type. Some readers say that mold\u00a0buildup continues to be a problem in front-loaders.\u00a0 Consider:  Maytag Maxima MHW5500FW , $800,  LG WM8500HVA , $800,\u00a0\u00a0 Maytag MHW3505FW , $650,  Samsung WF50K7500AW , $800,  Whirlpool WFW75HEFW , $720,  LG WM3670HWA,  $700,  Kenmore 41262 , $600, \u00a0and the  Samsung WF42H5600AW , $720. You'll see other washers for $800 or less that are also impressive in our  washer ratings .\u00a0 Tip:  A front-loader's high spin speeds might vibrate too much for the machine to be placed near a bedroom or family room, but keep in mind that concrete floors can absorb vibrations well, unlike wood-framed floors. You'll see vibration scores in our ratings.\u00a0 Agitator Top-Loaders If what you really want is an agitator top-loader, you'll see 25 in our  washing machine ratings . Consider the\u00a0 Kenmore 22242 , $480,  Maytag MVWB765FW , $800,  Maytag MVWC416FW , $400, and several others. Love Speed Queen? You'll see  Speed Queen  in our ratings of agitator top-loaders and front-loaders. Our\u00a0 washing machine ratings \u00a0tell the whole story. We rate washing performance, energy- and water efficiency, gentleness, noise, vibration, and cycle time (normal wash on heavy-soil setting). Claimed capacity is stated in cubic feet. The  best matching washers and dryers \u00a0helps you zero in on sets, and our  washer buying guide \u00a0 is good way to compare washer types and learn about all the features. \u2014 Kimberly Janeway\u00a0 More from Consumer Reports: Top pick tires for 2016 Best used cars for $25,000 and less 7 best mattresses for couples Consumer Reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this website.

While McConnell said he is in favor of \u201cborder security,\u201d the Kentucky Republican also suggested that in some places, a border wall \u201cis probably not the best way to secure the border.\u201d Trump has said that due to natural barriers, his wall project would not need to be continuous. Lawmakers in border states have said that a physical wall is not enough to secure the border \u2014 and that a combination of fencing, technology and patrol officers are needed in many areas. Trump has repeatedly vowed that Mexico would pay for his proposed wall, despite public refusals by Mexican officials. In January, Trump said that the wall would initially be funded by U.S. taxpayers \u201cfor the sake of speed\u201d and that the country would be reimbursed by Mexico at a later date.

To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\u201d Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that \u201cillegal border crossings\u201d \u2014 defined as crossings made by people who were detained or rejected at the border \u2014 fell by nearly 40 percent from January to February compared to the same period last year. \u201cThe early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement.

(KTUU-TV via AP) More JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Add sleep to the already long list of hazards in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. A video posted on the official race website shows a dog team that arrived at a checkpoint without a musher. \"Now you've seen it all, huh?\" a man in the video says. As the video scanned the faces of the mellow-mannered dogs, a man could be heard saying, \"Where's Linwood?\" That would be Linwood Fiedler, a race veteran. He arrived at the checkpoint about an hour behind his dogs after falling asleep and toppling off his sled, according to information accompanying the video. Fiedler checked in at 4:09 a.m. Thursday and was back on the trail at 11:37 a.m., race standings show. He told Anchorage television station KTUU that he had been fighting to stay awake. \"I was doing a pretty good job, and then I lost,\" he said, laughing. \"I'll tell you one thing. From the minute my body left the sled until my face smashed into the snow, I was still asleep,\" he said. Fiedler told the station he has fallen off his sled only a few times during his career. The last time it happened, he was awake, so he said, \"Whoa,\" and his dogs stopped. \"I was really hoping for a repeat of that last night,\" he said. \"You feel a little alone and naked walking down the Yukon River all by yourself in the middle of the night, looking at wolf tracks that every once in a while, you go, 'Hmm.'\" Fiedler began dog mushing in 1977, according to his profile on the race website. For the last 16 summers, he's operated a glacier tour business. Race director Mark Nordman said Fiedler faced no penalty for his separation from his dogs. \"It's another story for his book,\" he said. The winner of the nearly 1,000-mile race across Alaska is expected in Nome early next week.
