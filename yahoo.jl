The organizers of Boston's embattled St. Patrick's Day parade have scheduled an emergency meeting to reconsider their vote to shut out the gay veterans group. This week's decision to bar OutVets from marching drew immediate condemnation from high-profile politicians and stirred up a furor on social media. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) More BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Organizers of the city's St. Patrick's Day parade reversed course on Friday and said they would allow a group of gay veterans to march in this year's parade. The South Boston Allied War Veterans Council announced on the parade's Twitter account that it had signed an \"acceptance letter\" that would clear the way for OutVets to participate. OutVets did not immediately say whether it would accept the invitation to march. \"We are in receipt of a letter from the allied war council, and we are actively reviewing it,\" said Dee Dee Edmondson, a lawyer for the group. An earlier vote by the council to bar OutVets from marching drew immediate condemnation from high-profile politicians, some of whom said they would not march if the gay veterans were excluded. It caused some sponsors to back out and stirred up a furor on social media. It was unclear if the reversal of the decision was a result of a second vote by the council. \"I decided this is a wrong that has to be corrected,\" the parade's lead organizer, Tim Duross, told WHDH-TV. Earlier Friday, OutVets executive director Bryan Bishop said the vets had been told the original decision to bar them was because of their rainbow symbols. Bishop said the council offered to allow the group to march if its members did not display the rainbow flag, a symbol of gay pride, which is on their banner and their jackets. The group said no. \"I almost fell out of the chair at that point, said, 'You gotta be kidding me,'\" Bishop said. He said OutVets has displayed the rainbow at the parade the last two years. \"It infuriates me to look at the veterans that I know, gay and straight, who have served this country with valor and honor and distinction, and just because you're a veteran who happens to be gay your service is somehow less than someone who is not of the LGBT community or someone who's not gay,\" he said. Edmondson, the OutVets lawyer, described the letter as \"generic\" and said it did not make fully clear whether the gay group would be allowed to display its banner. Another veterans group, Veterans for Peace, said it also had been denied permission to participate. That group has been trying unsuccessfully for several years to march. OutVets was first allowed to participate in the parade in 2015, in what was seen as a groundbreaking decision after parade organizers had, for decades, resisted the inclusion of gay groups. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1995 upheld the council's right to bar gay groups on free speech grounds. The council said in a statement Thursday its decision had been misinterpreted. \"The council is accepting of all people and organizations, but it will not permit messages that conflict with the overall theme of the parade,\" the statement said. That decision resulted in backlash from other veterans' organizations. The council is made up of representatives from several South Boston American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts. The Michael J. Perkins American Legion Post said it had withdrawn from the council. The Perkins post in a statement on its Facebook page didn't mention the OutVets decision but said it decided to withdraw because \"recent efforts by several non-veteran parade volunteers to guide decision making has resulted in the subversion of the council as an organization being led by veterans.\" Another former member of the council, the Thomas J. Fitzgerald VFW Post, assailed the council's decision to bar OutVets. The Fitzgerald post withdrew from the council last year over the decision to bar Veterans for Peace.

The lack of Catholic priests is an \u201cenormous problem,\u201d Francis recently said, suggesting he would be open to allowing married men to be ordained as priests.     Tony Gentile/Reuters      There are already ordained married priests in the church. In 1980, Pope John Paul II decided to allow married men to become priests in limited circumstances, such as\u00a0married former clergymen from the Episcopal Church. Francis, 80, the first Jesuit and Latin American pontiff, took over the papacy from Pope Benedict XVI in March 2013. Since then, religious followers around the globe have viewed him as a progressive leader. His reign has meant a more inclusive and forgiving Roman Catholic Church\u00a0and has rhetorically broken with religious tradition in several cases, including allowing not just bishops but also priests\u00a0 to forgive abortion \u00a0and saying that the church could be more open to same-sex unions. Just last month, he suggested it\u2019s better to be an atheist than a hypocritical Catholic, meaning those whom he described   as living a \u201cdouble life\u201d  and starting scandals. Men and women in the Catholic Church serve different roles; only men can be ordained. In his   1994 apostolic letter , Pope John Paul II claimed that \u201cthe Church has no authority whatsoever\u201d to ordain women as priests; Jesus chose only men to serve as his 12 apostles. For decades, women have requested larger leadership positions within the church. While meeting with hundreds of leaders last spring, Francis indicated that he was\u00a0open to discussion about the possibility of ordaining women as deacons. Three months later, he went on to create\u00a0a commission to study the role of women deacons in the early church, namely Phoebe, who appears to be mentioned as a minister in the Bible.\u00a0A similar commission was formed in 2002 among high-level officials at the Vatican, and the panel produced a document that considered whether women might be eligible to become deacons. The members didn\u2019t reach a firm conclusion. Jeopardy\u00a0 has taken note. On Thursday, the Final Jeopardy question on the\u00a0game show asked, In which country, according to a 2011 report, does the citizenry include\u00a0a total of 32 women? The answer was the Vatican.

Gen. Joseph Votel, who heads U.S. Central Command, said he sees no need for additional investigations into the January mission that triggered debate in Washington over what went wrong and whether important intelligence was actually gathered. It was the first military raid authorized by President Donald Trump. Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee that a separate investigation into potential civilian casualties found that between four and 12 innocent people were killed. During the raid on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula militants, U.S. special operations forces came under heavy fire. Chief Special Warfare Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens was killed, six other American service members were injured and a helicopter was damaged. Among the civilians killed was the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and U.S. citizen who was targeted and killed by a drone strike in 2011. Votel, who presided over an internal review, said he was \"looking for information gaps where we can't explain what happened in a particular situation or we have conflicting information between members of the organization. I am looking for indicators of incompetence or poor decision making or bad judgment throughout all this.\" In the end, he said, \"I was satisfied that none of those indicators that I identified to you were present. I think we had a good understanding of exactly what happened on this objective and we've been able to pull lessons learned out of that, that we will apply in future operations.\" He said there was no need for an additional investigation. Votel added that he believes the U.S. gained valuable information on al-Qaida militants. Trump, who honored Owens' widow during his speech to Congress last week, has repeatedly defended the raid as highly successful. He told Congress that it \"generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" Votel said investigations into the helicopter crash are continuing. One is an aircraft safety investigation, intended to generate any important information for the helicopter fleet. The second is a look at what caused the helicopter to make a hard landing.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The top U.S. commander for the Middle East told senators Thursday that he has completed an exhaustive review of the Yemen raid that killed a Navy SEAL, and has concluded there were no lapses in judgment or decision-making surrounding the operation.", "title": "General says no bad decisions in Yemen raid, probe is over"}

The practice of sharing such photos goes beyond the Marine Corps and one Facebook group. Hundreds of nude photos of female service members from every military branch have been posted to an image-sharing message board that dates back to at least May. A source informed Business Insider of the site's existence on Tuesday. The site, called AnonIB, has a dedicated board for military personnel that features dozens of threaded conversations among men, many of whom ask for \"wins\" \u2014 naked photographs \u2014 of specific female service members, often identifying the women by name or where they are stationed. The revelation comes on the heels of an explosive story published on Saturday by the  journalist Thomas Brennan . He reported on a Facebook group called Marines United, which was home to approximately 30,000 members who were sharing nude photos of colleagues along with personal information and even encouragement of sexual assault. The report led the Marine Corps to open an investigation, spurred widespread outrage in the media and in Congress, and  prompted sharp condemnation  from the Corps' top leaders. According to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, investigators  are considering felony charges  that could carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. An official familiar with the matter told Business Insider that the Marine commandant, Gen. Robert Neller, would brief members of the House Armed Services Committee next week on the scandal. \"We're examining some of our policies to see if we can make them punitive in nature,\" the official said, adding that the Corps was taking the issue very seriously. A Facebook-group exodus leads to a message board's popularity View photos marine general neller More (Gen. Robert Neller, commandant of the Marine Corps. He is expected to brief Congress next week on the scandal.US Marine Corps/Cpl. Shawn Valosin)  Brennan's story also led to an apparent exodus of members from the private Facebook group, though some appeared to have found the publicly viewable message board soon after \u2014 with the express intent of finding the cache of nude images that Marines in the Facebook group were sharing. \"Come on Marines share the wealth here before that site is nuked and all is lost,\" one anonymous user said in a post on Monday, two days after Brennan's story was published. Follow-up replies offered a link to a Dropbox folder named \"Girls of MU\" with thousands of photographs. Dropbox did not respond to a request for comment. Members on the board often posted photos \u2014 seemingly stolen from female service members' Instagram accounts \u2014 before asking others if they had nude pictures of a female service member. For example, after posting the first name and photograph of a female soldier in uniform on January 21, one board member asked for \"Army chick went to [redacted], ig is [redacted].\" Another user, apparently frustrated that no pictures had yet been found, posted a few days later: \"BUMP. Let's see them t------.\" On another thread, a member posted a photograph on May 30 of a female service member with her breasts exposed and said, \"She is in the navy down in san diego, anyone have any more wins?\" View photos us navy guam More (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Sean M. Castellano)  One user followed up on June 13, offering another nude photo of the woman. \"Keep them coming! She's got them floating around someone [sic] and I've wanted to see this for a while,\" another user wrote in response. Some requested nude photographs by unit or location. One user asked in September for photos of women in the Massachusetts National Guard, while another requested some from the Guard in Michigan. Other requests included nude pictures of any women stationed at Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas, or Naval Medical Center in San Diego, along with many more US military installations around the world. In statements to Business Insider, military branches denounced the message board and promised discipline for any service members who engaged in misconduct. \"This alleged behavior is inconsistent with our values,\" Lt. Col. Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, told Business Insider. Capt. Ryan Alvis, a spokeswoman for the Marine Corps, told Business Insider that the service expects the discovery of the Marines United page will motivate others to come forward to report other pages like it. \"Marines will attack this problem head-on and continue to get better,\" Alvis said.

Jennifer Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Army, told Business Insider: \"The Army is a values-based organization where everyone is expected to be treated with dignity and respect. As members of the Army team, individuals' interaction offline and online reflect on the Army and its values. Soldiers or civilian employees who participate in or condone misconduct, whether offline or online, may be subject to criminal, disciplinary, and/or administrative action.\" Air Force spokesman Zachary Anderson told Business Insider: \"We expect our Airmen to adhere to these values at all times and to treat their fellow service members with the highest degree of dignity and respect. Any conduct or participation in activities, whether online or offline, that does not adhere to these principles will not be tolerated. Airmen or civilian employees who engage in activities of misconduct that demean or disrespect fellow service members will be appropriately disciplined.\" The Navy did not respond to a request for comment. 'Hope we can find more on this gem' The image board hosts disturbing conversations that in many cases appear to be between active-duty personnel. \"Any wins of [redacted]?\" read one request, which shared further details about a female Marine's whereabouts, indicating the user likely worked with her in the past. Another thread, posted in November, that had dozens of follow-up comments from users acting as cyber-sleuths to track down the victim started with a single photograph of a female Marine, fully clothed, taken from her Instagram account. \"Any wins?\" that user asked, telling others the Marine's first name and where she had been stationed. One user hinted at her last name as others scoured her Instagram account, posting more photos they had found. One photo of the victim and her friend prompted one user to ask for nude photos of the friend as well: \"Any of the dark haired girl in the green shirt and jeans next to her?\" View photos American soldiers are seen at the U.S. army base in Qayyara, south of Mosul REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani More (Thomson Reuters)  The thread carried on for months. \"Amazing thread,\" one user wrote. \"Hope we can find more on this gem.\" In December, a nude photo was finally posted. \"Dudeee more,\" one user wrote in response. Many others responded by \"bumping\" the thread to the top so that others on the board would see it and potentially post more photos. Indeed, more photos soon appeared from the victim's Instagram account, which was apparently made private or shut down numerous times. On the board, users complained that her Instagram account kept disappearing, apparently because she was trying to thwart her harassers. But others quickly found her new accounts and told others, and the new Instagram account names were shared throughout February. \"Oh god please someone have that p----,\" one user wrote. View photos blurred1 More (Screenshot)  The site that hosts the message board seems to have little moderation and few rules, though it tells users \"Don't be evil.\" Its rules instruct members to not post personal details such as addresses, telephone numbers, links to social networks, or last names. Still, many users on the board do not appear to follow those rules. In one popular thread, started on January 9, an anonymous user posted non-nude pictures of a female airman, telling others in the caption: \"Anyone know her or have anything else on her? I've got a lot more if there is interest. Would love for her friends and family to see these.\" The user, who suggested in the accompanying captions that he was a jilted ex-boyfriend, posted many more photos in the hours and days after. \"She knows how to end it all. If she does get in contact with me I won't post anymore. So get it while it's hot!\" he wrote. Later in the thread, the man even referred to the airman by name and told her to check her Instagram messages. View photos air force More (AP/John L. Mone)  \"Wow, she blocked me on Instagram!\" he later wrote. \"Stupid c--- must want me to post her s--- up. I gave her a choice, it didn't have to be this way. I'm not a bad guy, she had a choice. Oh well, no point in holding back now. I want you all to share this everywhere you can, once I start seeing her more places I'll post her video.\" Aside from those on active duty, some users who identified themselves as cadets at some military service academies started threads to try to find nude photos of their female classmates. In a thread dedicated to the US Military Academy at West Point, some users who appeared to be cadets shared photos and graduation years of their female classmates. \"What about the basketball locker room pics, I know someone has those,\" one user said, apparently referring to photos taken surreptitiously in a women's locker room. \"I always wondered whether those made it out of the academy computer system,\" another user responded. In 2012, an Army sergeant who helped train and mentor cadets was discovered to have secretly filmed more than a dozen women  in the bathroom and shower areas  at West Point. The soldier  pleaded guilty in the case  and was sentenced in 2014 to 33 months in prison. View photos marines More (US Marine Corps photo)  \"Bumping all 3 service academies' threads to see who can post the best wins in the next 7 days. Winning school gets the [commander's cup],\" one user wrote. \"Go Army, Beat Everyone.\" Lt. Col. Christopher Kasker, a spokesman for the US Military Academy, told Business Insider:\u00a0\"The content on this image board or other websites, attributed to both West Point graduates and our fellow service members, is both alarming and contrary to our values. When alerted to incidents such as this, we thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action.\" 'This has to be treated harshly' The existence of a site dedicated solely to sharing nude photographs of female service members is another black mark for the Pentagon, which has been criticized in the past for failing to deal with rampant sexual harassment and abuse within the ranks. A 2014 Rand Corporation  study estimated  that more than 20,000 service members had been sexually assaulted in the previous year. Nearly six times as many reported being sexually harassed. In some cases, the military has pushed out  victims of sexual assault who reported it , instead of the perpetrators. \"I'm kind of surprised. I'm still naive, I think, on some level,\" said Kate Hendricks Thomas, a former Marine Corps officer who is now an assistant professor at Charleston Southern University. \"I am really disappointed to hear that the reach is broader than 30,000 and a couple of now-defunct websites.\" Thomas criticized past responses to the problem, in which some had indicated the issue was too difficult for the military to wrap its arms around. \"This renders us less mission-effective. It's got to be a priority,\" she said. \"These websites are not boys being boys,\" she added. \"This is a symptom of rape culture.\" The message board also presents a challenge for military leaders, who may face an uphill battle in trying to find \u2014 and potentially prosecute \u2014 active-duty service members who shared photos on the site. Unlike the Marines United Facebook group, where many users posted under their real names, the message board's user base is mostly anonymous, and the site itself is registered in the Bahamas, outside the jurisdiction of US law enforcement. Brad Moss, a lawyer who specializes in national-security issues, told Business Insider that the military may have a hard time persuading the internet service provider to shut down the website. Instead, he said, the victims themselves may have more legal standing if they were to contact the ISP to remove the photos. Still, Moss said he believes the military could squash the behavior if it adopted a \"zero-tolerance\" posture. \"I think that absolutely, 100%, should be the policy if they catch the main perpetrators who are sharing these photos around and essentially engaging in revenge porn,\" Moss said. \"They should have a zero-tolerance policy and boot them from the military with a dishonorable discharge. \"If they do anything less, it's only going to incentivize this behavior in the future,\" he added. \"This has to be treated harshly.\" This article was updated on 3/10 at 6:40 a.m. PDT to add a statement from the US Military Academy.

For a long time, she followed dieting tips she found on websites promoting anorexia, which led to a self-destructive mindset and restrictive eating habits. In recent years, things have gotten much better: Inspired by a quote she picked up from body positivity advocate  Megan Crabbe  (@bodyposipanda) - \"You will never hate yourself into loving yourself\u201d - Martina felt empowered to give herself a break and simply accept her body for what it is. It's an approach that's helping her become more comfortable in her skin and learn to love her body. As an artist majoring in sculpture, and conflict analysis and dispute resolution, Martina likes finding ways to reflect her own personal journey through art. So she decided to create a live performance project titled \u201cThe Hidden Secret of Eating Disorders,\u201d timed to correspond with  National Eating Disorders Awareness Week . \"I wanted to create a sculpture that depicted the darkness and entrapment of a negative body image, self-hate, and eating disorders,\" she explains. So Martina constructed a standing closet large enough to fit one person. Inside, she burned the message, \"Welcome,\" signed by \"Ana,\" on a doormat to represent anorexia. She covered the rest of the floor with scales covered with the words that go through many people's minds when they're silently suffering from disordered eating. View photos Photo credit: Lilly Metcalfe More The structure's walls are made from black plastic with a dual meaning: The material represents the trashcan some sufferers use to purge, and at the same time, a body bag for those who die from striving to reach unrealistic standards of beauty. There are also broken mirrors to represent feelings of insufficiency and insecurity. Martina parked the sculpture on campus, then asked people to enter the closet, one at a time, and reflect on these issues by writing on the walls. At the same time, she wanted to project body positivity and raise awareness with a statement of self-love  outside  the closet. To illustrate her vulnerability, she decided to wear a nude body suit in public - a big deal, since she doesn't typically skip around campus in her skivvies, and even tends to avoid swimming pools to sidestep the whole swimsuit thing. It's one reason she mentally freaked out once her clothes came off: \"The second that I pulled down my pants [outside], all I could think in my head was, 'I am actually doing this. I am actually doing this.'\" View photos Photo credit: Courtesy of Martina Maya-Callen More On her body, she used a black marker to write out the negative thoughts that have long plagued her and are often internalized, like \"not enough,\" and \"ugly.\" Then, she invited the public to write whatever they wanted onto her body. After posting photos of her project online, Martina received some threatening comments from people who insist eating disorders don't exist or that she's \"fat.\" \"[Negative feedback] makes me realize just how needed this project is to spread awareness for eating disorders and these issues because people are uneducated,\" Martina says. In sum, the response to her public art performance suggests it was a great success: One photo she posted on Instagram was liked by more than 26,000 people - a lot, considering she has just over 5,000 followers. She's also heard from many people who've been inspired by her message. \"After this project, I feel more confident in my body and am truly further in my journey of self-love,\" she says. \"[But] it's [also] about all the other people who look in the mirror and feel like they are not good enough,\" she says. \"[I'm] unbelievably happy that I could be a catalyst to people\u2019s journey of self-love.\" Martina raising money to take her project on the road through selling body-positive and eating disorder awareness T-shirts, which you can purchase by contacting her via her  website .

Sessions is seeking the resignations of 46 United States attorneys who were appointed during the prior presidential administration, the Justice Department said Friday, March 10, 2017. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) More WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions is seeking the resignations of 46 United States attorneys who were appointed during prior presidential administrations, the Justice Department said Friday. Many of the federal prosecutors who were nominated by former President Barack Obama have already left their positions, but the nearly four dozen who stayed on in the first weeks of the Trump administration have been asked to leave \"in order to ensure a uniform transition,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said. \"Until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. attorney's offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting and deterring the most violent offenders,\" she said in a statement. By Friday evening, U.S. attorneys around the country \u2014 including New Jersey, Rhode Island, Minnesota and Montana \u2014 had publicly announced their resignations. It's fairly customary for the 93 U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, but the departures are not automatic and don't necessarily happen all at once. One U.S. attorney appointed by President George W. Bush, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, remained on the job for the entire Obama administration and is the current nominee for deputy attorney general in the Trump administration. A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, said late Friday that President Donald Trump has asked Rosenstein and Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, who has served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to stay on. For more  news videos  visit  Yahoo View , available now on  iOS  and  Android . The action was similar to one taken in 1993 by then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who soon after taking office sought the resignations of the U.S. attorneys appointed by President George H.W. Bush. At the time, Sessions was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. Tim Purdon, a former U.S. attorney for North Dakota in the Obama administration, recalled that President Barack Obama permitted Bush appointees to remain on until their successors had been appointed and confirmed. \"The way the Obama administration handled it was appropriate and respectful and classy,\" Purdon said. \"This saddens me because many of these people are great public servants and now they are being asked to leave.\" U.S. attorneys are federal prosecutors who are nominated by the president, generally upon the recommendation of a home-state senator, and are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes in the territories they oversee. They report to Justice Department leadership in Washington, and their priorities are expected to be in line with those of the attorney general. Sessions took perhaps a veiled swipe at their work in a memo earlier this week, saying that prosecutions for violent crime have been on the decline even as the number of murders has gone up. The demand for resignations seems a way to ensure he will have a team of new federal prosecutors more likely to share his agenda. Friday's announcement came months after Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan and one of the most prominent federal prosecutors, said he'd been asked by Trump to stay on and that he intended to. Bharara's office declined to comment Friday. Montana's U.S. Attorney Mike Cotter said he received a phone call from Boente telling him \"the president has directed this.\" \"I think it's very unprofessional and I'm very disappointed,\" he said. \"What happened today on Friday, March 10, that was so important that all Obama appointees who are U.S. attorneys need to be gone?\" \"I gotta write that (resignation) letter. It's going to be a one-liner,\" he added. ____ Associated Press writer Matt Volz in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to show that it's fairly customary for the 93 U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, not that it's not customary.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions is seeking the resignations of 46 United States attorneys who were appointed during prior presidential administrations, the Justice Department said Friday.", "title": "Attorney general seeks resignations of 46 US attorneys"}

Such unimpressive performance results in you throwing money down the drain.\u00a0 To help you steer clear of laundry products that don't work as promised, here's a list of the worst laundry products from our tests\u2014they scored 40 or lower overall out of 100.\u00a0 Washing Machines These washers earned only a fair score overall, with a score of 39 or lower in our tests. And while some of the prices are appealing, there are better choices in our  washing machine ratings , often for the same price. Front-Loading Washing Machines   The bottom-rated  Electrolux EFLW417SlW , $600, did a superb job cleaning but was tough on fabrics and didn't extract as much water as the others\u2014that means the dryer runs longer to dry the load. High-Efficiency Top-Loading Washers\u00a0   The  Frigidaire Affinity FAHE4045QW , $720, was very good at cleaning, and the\u00a0 Affinity FAHE1011MW , $700, did an excellent job. But they used about twice as much water as the most efficient HE top-loaders and didn't extract much of that water, and were rougher on fabrics than most. The\u00a0 Samsung WA40J3000AW , $380, \u00a0 is the least expensive HE top-loader in our tests but\u00a0used even more water than the Frigidaire washers and still left a lot of stains on fabrics, putting it at the bottom of the  HE top-loader ratings .\u00a0 Agitator Top-Loading Washers\u00a0   Agitator washers usually cost $500 or less, including the top-rated  Kenmore 22242 , $480. The worst from our tests left many of the stains on our test fabrics, while using more water than a number of the other agitator machines\u2014helping to put the\u00a0 Whirlpool WTW4816FW ,\u00a0$450;\u00a0 Amana NTW4516FW ,\u00a0$300; and\u00a0 Roper RTW4516FW , $275, at the bottom of the\u00a0 agitator washer ratings .\u00a0 Clothes Dryers Any dryer will get the job done, eventually. But a money-wasting dryer might take longer, use higher heat, or overdry laundry when you want clothes a bit damp. All of this is harder on fabrics and uses more energy. Among electric dryers, the\u00a0 Frigidaire Affinity FARE1011MW , $630; the\u00a0 Hotpoint HTDP120EDWW , $450; and\u00a0the\u00a0 GE GTDX180EDWW , $450, were the worst at drying, scoring 32 or lower in our tests. (Based on decades of testing, we've determined that gas versions of dryers perform similarly to electric models; we expect the related gas models in our ratings to do just as poorly.) Laundry Detergents With laundry detergents, you can waste money in a couple of ways. Detergents that don't clean well might require you to redo a load. And, if you don't measure the detergent beforehand, you might end up using more than you need. Scoring 40 or less in our tests, these detergents were no match for common stains from body oil, dirt, and grass.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse More ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government proposed on Friday making non-EU foreigners sell their homes when they leave the country, prompting resistance from the real estate sector. More than three decades after Switzerland liberalized property purchases for foreigners, and amid concern that foreign demand helps drive up prices, the cabinet said it was time to update the law to close loopholes and improve enforcement. It suggested requiring citizens from countries outside the European Union plus Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway to get permission to buy main residences in Switzerland. \"Permits should always be linked to the duty to sell the home again as soon as residence in Switzerland is relinquished,\" the government said, as it opened a period of public comment before sending draft legislation to parliament. It also proposed tightening rules covering other types of property investment by foreigners. A real-estate lobbying group called Lex Koller Remains Modern, a reference to the original law that opened the property market to foreigners, blasted the proposals as a \"nonsensical tightening\" of the rules. These measures, if adopted, \"would pose unacceptable disadvantages for property owners while exacerbating the situation on housing markets\" it said in a statement, adding that parliament had already opposed similar changes in 2014. The lobbying group said foreigners were not to blame for overly expensive or scarce residential housing. Rising demand in an increasingly prosperous society with smaller households and more immigrants was to blame for driving rental prices higher, it said. A study by Credit Suisse this month concluded that rental prices are actually falling amid strong construction investment driven by negative Swiss interest rates. Prices of owner-occupied housing are no longer rising after a 14-year period of price growth ended late last year, the bank said.

On a mission to rehabilitate its image, Turkey is instead inching closer to being an outcast among Western nations that seem to understand their NATO ally less and less each day. (Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Press Service, Pool Photo via AP, File) More ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 On a mission to rehabilitate its image, Turkey is instead inching closer to being an outcast among Western nations that seem to understand their NATO ally less and less each day. Eight months after a failed coup shattered its delicate status quo, Turkey is mounting a concerted but thus far futile campaign to convince the outside world that the horrors of that day justify both its post-coup crackdown and a referendum on strengthening presidential powers. So too has Turkey been unable to convince the U.S. that the shadowy, exiled cleric it blames for the coup attempt is culpable and must be extradited. Squeezed between Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has sought to project an image of a modern democracy that serves as a bulwark against the extremism menacing so many of its Mideast neighbors. Yet a series of self-defeating steps are telling reminders of how wide a gulf still separates Turkey from the Western world. \"I'm not saying that we're perfect. We're not. I'm not saying that mistakes aren't being made,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek. But he said the outside world must \"at least try to understand the traumatic experience that Turkey has been going through.\" This week, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seemed to stoke tensions further when he accused Germany of \"Nazi practices\" after Turkish leaders had been prevented from rallying expats in several Germany cities in support of the referendum. Many in Europe worry that Erdogan is capitalizing on post-coup fears to push through a more authoritarian system with few checks on his power. For the West, there are real risks if Turkey feels estranged and mistreated. The country is pivotal to resolving the unrelenting civil war in neighboring Syria, where Turkey and the U.S. are at a logjam over Turkey's distrust of the Syrian Kurdish fighters the U.S. is relying on to fight the Islamic State group. And though Turkey's bid to join the European Union has lost momentum, Turkey holds major leverage by way of its deal with the EU to stem the flow of refugees into Europe, which Turkey has threatened to scuttle. Turkey's inability to make its case to the West effectively was displayed this week in the capital, Ankara, whose mayor invited a group of American journalists to interview Erdogan and other top officials, including Turkey's foreign minister, intelligence chief and military commander. After flying to Turkey, the journalists discovered there were no interviews arranged with those officials. Instead, they spoke with other officials, including the mayor, Melih Gokcek, a member of Erdogan's party. He screened graphic videos aiming to reinforce how traumatic the coup attempt had been. Then he offered unfounded conspiracy theories that the U.S. created the Islamic State group and that the U.S. and Israel colluded to artificially trigger an earthquake in Turkey so they could capture energy from the fault line. Underlying Turkey's strategy to explain itself to the West is an apparent belief that its case is most convincing when couched in bedrock Western principles, regardless of whether the appeals to those principles seem credible. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag, who also met with the visiting group, claimed no journalists in Turkey are in prison for doing journalism, even though scores have been arrested. Since the failed coup, at least 100 news outlets have been forcibly closed in a clampdown Human Rights Watch says has \"all but silenced independent media.\" Yet Bozdag insisted any journalists in prison were there for drugs, trespassing or for \"propagandizing for terrorist organizations.\" Turkish leaders have expressed exasperation that they are lambasted for the steps they took after the coup while France gets a \"pass\" for the state of emergency imposed after the 2015 Paris attacks. But France \u2014 unlike Turkey \u2014 didn't arrest 41,000 people and purge 100,000 from its civil service. Likewise, Turkey has sought to appeal to Americans' own experiences with terrorism by repeatedly comparing 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden to Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric Turkey says plotted the coup. Gulen, living in exile in Pennsylvania, denies involvement. Although Turkey says it has provided roughly a half million pieces of evidence to support its extradition request, the U.S. remains unconvinced. What little evidence Turkey has made public has been mostly anecdotes about arrested military members confessing loyalty to Gulen's movement. Aykan Erdemir, a former member of Turkey's parliament, said there are frequent and ineffective efforts taking place in Western cities and in Turkey to burnish Turkey's image, often comprising poorly planned presentations alleging Gulen's guilt. But Erdermir said the West isn't the only intended audience. Because Erdogan's Justice and Development Party once had close ties to Gulen's group, the party's leaders are vulnerable to being implicated if the post-coup crackdown moves higher up the power structure, Erdemir said. \"A lot of people are trying to prove to Erdogan they are holier than thou, that they are fighting the anti-Gulen crusade at least as enthusiastically,\" said Erdemir, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"One of the best defenses is doing such stunts. It really is a paranoid moment in Turkish political history.\" ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP", "description": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 On a mission to rehabilitate its image, Turkey is instead inching closer to being an outcast among Western nations that seem to understand their NATO ally less and less each day.", "title": "With flair but scant success, Turkey aims to repair image"}

In an interview with CNBC, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the Trump administration will make an announcement on fuel efficiency standards for cars \"very soon,\" stressing that he and President Donald Trump believe current standards were rushed through. Pruitt, 48, is a climate change denier who sued the agency he now leads more than a dozen times as Oklahoma's attorney general. He said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal is the main cause of climate change, a conclusion widely embraced by scientists. \"I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,\" he told CNBC. \"So no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,\" Pruitt said. \"But we don\u2019t know that yet, we need to continue to debate, continue the review and analysis.\u201d Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back environmental regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, including those aimed at combating climate change. He framed his stand as aimed at boosting U.S. businesses, including the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries. \"We can be pro-growth, pro-jobs and pro-environment,\" Pruitt said Wednesday afternoon in a Houston speech at CERAWeek, the world's largest gathering of energy executives. Scientists immediately criticized Pruitt's statement, saying it ignores a large body of evidence collected over decades that shows fossil fuel burning as the main factor in climate change. \"We can\u2019t afford to reject this clear and compelling scientific evidence when we make public policy. Embracing ignorance is not an option,\" Ben Santer, climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said in a statement. The Supreme Court unleashed a fury of regulation and litigation when it ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Two years later, the EPA declared carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping gases to be pollutants. Pruitt said the Supreme Court's decision should not have been viewed as permission for the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. \"Decisions were made at the executive branch level that didn't respect the rule of law,\" Pruitt said in his Houston speech. REGULATING CO2 Pruitt has previously said the EPA should not regulate CO2 without a law passed by Congress authorizing it to do so. The Republican-controlled Congress could potentially issue a strong signal to the EPA that carbon dioxide should not be regulated by the agency, a move that would undermine many Obama-era rules aimed at curbing emissions. \"Administrator Pruitt is correct, the Congress has never explicitly given the EPA the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the committee has no plans to do so,\" said Mike Danylak, spokesman for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the panel that oversees the EPA. When asked at his confirmation hearing in January whether he would uphold the EPA endangerment finding, Pruitt said it was the \"law of the land\" and he was obliged to uphold it for now. Pruitt declined to respond to a question from a reporter after his Houston speech on whether he would now seek to overturn the endangerment finding. As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Pruitt and another dozen attorney generals unsuccessfully challenged the endangerment finding in a federal appeals court. \"The mask is off. After obscuring his true views during his Senate confirmation hearings, Scott Pruitt has outed himself as a pure climate denier,\" said David Doniger, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The new EPA chief said he was committed to ensuring thorough processes for environmental rules and regulations to reduce \"regulatory uncertainty.\" Pruitt added that he shared Trump's view that the global climate accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015 was a \"bad deal.\" Trump promised during his campaign for the White House to pull the United States out of the accord, but has since been mostly quiet on the issue.

This is especially true for people who have switched from a traditional agitator top-loader to a high-efficiency top-loader. Some are so concerned that they add more water to the machine with a bucket or garden hose.\u00a0    That's a really bad idea. In fact, adding too much water can result in dingier clothes. \"Cleaning may worsen because the clothes aren\u2019t rubbing against each other in all that water\u2014it's not what the machine\u2019s design intended,\" says Emilio Gonzalez, the engineer who runs Consumer Reports' laundry appliance tests.    In recent years, as federal standards have become increasingly tough, washers are using less water and energy. An agitator top-loader that we tested 20 years ago might have used more than 40 gallons of water to wash an average load. Today\u2019s agitator machines use considerably less, and HE top-loaders and front-loaders use far less than that.    You'll know your washer is using too little water if the cottons come out dirty, or are nearly dry straight out of the washer. \"The only time we saw a model use extremely low levels of water, less than 2 gallons, our laundry came out dirty,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe figured out that that  LG front-loader  had a software problem, which the manufacturer fixed.\"    To compare the water use of one type of washer to another, we went into our labs recently and ran tests using an 8-pound load, using the normal-wash heavy-soil setting. Here are the results. Agitator Top-Loader (19 Gallons) Some agitator top-loaders still submerge dirty loads in water, with the least water efficient in our ratings using about 25 to 26 gallons to wash an average load. The  Maytag MVWB765FW , $800, scored a Good in cleaning, and a Good in our water-efficiency tests, using 19 gallons to wash our load. That's typical for other agitator washers with an automatic load-sensing feature. It adds the right amount of water based on the weight of the load. View photos  \u00a0 High-Efficiency Top-Loader (13 Gallons) The\u00a0 Whirlpool WTW8700EC \u00a0HE top-loader, $1,200, used 13 gallons to wash our load. It scored an Excellent in our water-efficiency tests and a Very Good in cleaning. HE top-loaders, which don't have an agitator, typically use 12 to 17 gallons of water in our tests. What do the results look like? \"In many models the laundry is washed in a shallow pool of water. In some models, the water level is so low you may never even see a pool of water,\" says the\u00a0 American Cleaning Institute . \u00a0 View photos  \u00a0 Front-Loader (7 Gallons) As a group, front-loaders are the most water-efficient washing machines in our tests, scoring a Very Good or an Excellent in this test. The\u00a0 Whirlpool WFW85HEFW , $810, scored an Excellent, using 7 gallons to wash our test load, and did a very good job cleaning. View photos Sensible Ways to Add Water to Your Washer Forget about adding water from an outside source. Instead use the washer's settings to increase the amount of water for a load. Front-loaders, HE top-loaders, and some newer agitator\u00a0washers rely on a load-sensing feature to adjust the amount of water, based on the weight of the load. You cab can boost water use with a heavy-soil setting; heavy-duty cycle; bulky-items cycle; extra-rinse \u00a0 option; fabric-softener option; or deep-fill option. Manufacturers' websites might offer other options, and some, including\u00a0 Whirlpool , tell you how to reset your high-efficiency washer to the water levels set at the factory, important if your washer seems to be using less water than it first did.

One of them most likely depicts the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh Ramses II, who ruled Egypt over 3,000 years ago, while the other one is a limestone statue of the 12th century B.C. ruler Seti II. The statues were discovered near the entrance of the temple of Ramses II, which is situated in Heliopolis, an ancient city in the eastern part of modern-day Cairo. The discovery, made by the country's antiquities ministry, has been hailed as\u00a0extremely important. \"Last Tuesday they called me to announce the big discovery of a colossus of a king, most probably Ramses II, made out of quartzite,\" Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani  told Reuters on Thursday  at the site where the statues were unveiled. The archeologists said that the statue likely to be of the Ramses II measures\u00a0eight meters (26.24 feet)\u00a0and the other one, whose upper part was found, is said to be 80 centimeters (31.5 inches)\u00a0long. \"We found the bust of the statue and the lower part of the head and now we removed the head and we found the crown and the right ear and a fragment of the right eye,\" Anani said, while speaking about the Ramses II statue. The archeologists said they will now try to unearth the remaining portions of the statues before they finally restore them. If they are successful,\u00a0and if the statue is identified as Ramses II's,\u00a0it will be placed at the entrance of the Grand Egyptian Museum, which is expected to open in 2018. RTS125UT More      Archaeologists said the statues depict Pharaoh Ramses II who ruled Egypt over 3,000 years. These were unearthed in the Matariya area in Cairo, Egypt, March 9, 2017.

Dietrich Raue, who headed the German team, also said that the excavation was important and added that parts of the statues were being taken to some other place for restoration. \"The sun god created the world in Heliopolis, in Matariya. That's what I always tell the people here when they say is there anything important. According to the pharaonic belief, the world was created in Matariya,\" Raue said. \"That means everything had to be built here. Statues, temples, obelisks, everything. But ... the king never lived in Matariya, because it was the sun god living here.\" The discovery comes close on the heels of the excavation of remains of a 600 B.C. palace in Mosul, Iraq.\u00a0The remains, found under the ruins of a shrine destroyed by ISIS, are believed to date back to\u00a0the Assyrian empire,  according to the Telegraph . \"I can only imagine how much Daesh (ISIS) discovered down there before we got here,\"\u00a0archeologist Layla Salih told the Telegraph. She has been supervising the team that is identifying the unearthed pieces one after the other. \"We believe they took many of the artifacts, such as pottery and smaller pieces, away to sell.
