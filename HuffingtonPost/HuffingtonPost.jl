Make no mistake, he warned:\u00a0\u201cMelania Trump is as ugly on the inside as she is pretty on the outside.\u201d\u00a0 \n \u201cI f**king hate Melania Trump,\u201d Savage said in the episode, a snippet of which can be heard above. Noting that some have come to view the first lady as a \u201cpretty princess in the tower locked up by the orange ogre\u201d since her husband\u2019s inauguration, Savage called Melania Trump out for her apparent transgressions.\u00a0 \n \u201cPretty Melania went on TV to push the same racist  conspiracy theories  about  Barack Obama  that her husband did. She\u2019s an immigrant who doesn\u2019t give a sh*t about the plight of other immigrants,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s famously  a plagiarist , and she\u2019s brought ruinous lawsuits against journalists and bloggers, accusing them \u2015 amongst other things \u2015 of potentially interfering with her ability to profit off her role as first lady.\u201d\u00a0 \n Later, Savage pointed to a  March 2 ThinkProgress article  detailing the first lady\u2019s  recent visit  to Children\u2019s National Medical Center, a hospital in Washington D.C., where she called on \u201cthe gift of nature and the beauties of the outdoors\u201d to heal seriously ill children.\u00a0 \n Thank you for welcoming me  @ChildrensHealth .

Even though I live in Vienna and am not directly affected by Trumps presidency in the same way my American friends and family are, it is extremely painful to watch how this man is turning a whole country and its values upside down. Every day, my life begins and ends with Trump. In the morning I reach sleepy-eyed for my phone while laying still in bed and read about the latest media scandal. When I go to bed I open the New York Times app one more time to check what has happened. \n For a while, I tried abstaining from the news, but I am proud to admit that I have found something that works much better: weight lifting. \n A couple of months ago I started a crossfit-similar exercise regimen that is mainly about lifting weights. Kettlebells, bar-bells, push-ups with 10 pounds laying on top of you. It sounds really hard, because it is. \n In my first group lesson, I almost blacked out from the fast repetition of exercises, followed by the feeling of throwing up. When the lesson was over and everyone high-fived each other, tears were rolling down my cheeks \u2015 a bodily response of relief. But it got better very quickly. \n I have never been particularly interested in sports before, and besides the occasional yoga class, they never played a big role in my life. Sports basically meant YouTube Yoga or YouTube Pilates for me. I once started a 30 Day YouTube Yoga Challenge and it took me eight days to get past \u201cDay 4\u201d. \n However, I am now completely in love with weight lifting. Not just because it is exercise for my body, but it gives me the piece of mind in a way that yoga never could. Weight lifting turns my brain in a blank slate. Nothing (including sleeping or watching TV) can reach that same level of calm for me than 30 squats with a 26 pound kettle bell in my hands. \n While my body is preoccupied with exercise repetitions and, let\u2019s face it, constant pain, my brain can relax. Whereas in yoga groups you are encouraged to \u201cthink about your day and let it all go,\u201d weight lifting doesn\u2019t even get you to this contemplative point. With stretching and staying in the downward facing dog for what feels like hours, my brain was still able to think about Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban or his latest attack on the news media. Yoga might as well have been as well be called \u201cMeditating with Trump.\u201d \n Strength training has been associated with increasing brain function in multiple studies. It is said to  slow dementia  and  increase long-term memory function  by 10 percent. It also lowers stress, which can accumulate easily these days just by reading the news. Exercise promotes the production of hormones such as norepinephrine, while at the same time lowering cortisol levels significantly. \n While Cardio and other forms of exercise still leave some room for you to think about current events, strength training doesn\u2019t. Instead of thinking about alternative facts, or immigration policies, the only things I can really think or rather feel about are  \u201cWATER!\u201d, \u201cTOWEL!\u201d\u201d, \u201cONE MORE!\u201d, all in capital letters and exclamation marks. \n Since Trump got elected, many people have taken up new habits to personally deal with the constant news, be it going to events, stress eating, or obsessively caring about their nails like  Jeanne Vaccaro , a postdoctoral fellow at Indiana University. While this might feel like an overtly personal act of self-care it is also a means to be stronger in order to face the new reality head on. It means dealing with it, instead of hiding from it. Dealing with it also means being active to counteract what is happening: be it going to the women\u2019s march, tweeting or having a very long and complicated conversation with your relative or friend. \n Weight lifting helps me with all of that and I am only getting stronger every day. \n Rebecca Vogels is the author of the blog  You Might Also Like .

The pickup stunt in their hometown of Corona, in Southern California, quickly joined the lineup and got nearly 1 million hits. It was still posted Friday night. \n But things got serious fast when police were tipped off to the video and cited Rocco\u2019s mom and her boyfriend on suspicion of\u00a0 child endangerment, a misdemeanor , reported Los Angeles\u2019 ABC-7 TV.\u00a0 \n The couple also got a ticket for  illegal dumping , according to a police statement.

This last promise\u00a0\u2015 as\u00a0 comments from Trump \u00a0and  those close to him  later demonstrated \u2015 would allow the government to  prioritize Christians  from Middle Eastern countries over Muslims.\u00a0 \n On Monday, Trump signed a  new, watered-down version  of the order. Among the changes was the removal of special privileges for religious minorities. The initial proposal, the new order claims, wasn\u2019t intended to be a \u201cbasis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion.\u201d The policy would have applied to \u201crefugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion,\u201d Monday\u2019s order stated. \n Nonetheless the proposal was removed \u2015 likely because, as immigration lawyers, political scientists, and State Department officials argued in interviews with The Huffington Post, it would have been impractical and potentially illegal to implement. \n\n \n \n \nFox News\n \n \n\n\n The Definition Of A Refugee \n The U.S. doesn\u2019t currently accept refugees for resettlement on the basis of religious affiliation, alone. Being a member of a religious minority may be one factor that qualifies someone as a refugee, but only if that membership has resulted in persecution. \n The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, and the U.S. State Department  define a refugee  as someone who has been forced to flee his or her country due to persecution, war or violence. In cases of persecution, the refugee must have a well-founded fear of being oppressed based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. \n Being a member of a minority faith isn\u2019t always at the crux of religious persecution. In Syria and Iraq, for instance, the Islamic State has  touted ideological reasons \u00a0for terrorizing Christians, Muslims and other faith groups alike. But the militant group has actually\u00a0 targeted the Shiite Muslim majority \u00a0most frequently. And even though it claims Sunni Muslim allegiance, the Islamic State has killed and displaced other Sunni Muslims in greater numbers than Christians,  NPR reported .\u00a0 \n \n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" \n \n\n In 2016, the country with the  largest share of refugees admitted  to the U.S. was the Christian-majority Democratic Republic of the Congo. Of overall refugee admissions to the U.S. that year, Muslims made up 46 percent and Christians accounted for 44 percent. \n The definition of a refugee stated above is widely accepted by refugee-receiving countries around the world \u2015 and it doesn\u2019t call out either religious minorities or members of any particular faith. If Trump wanted to prioritize Christians, ostensibly he could have pushed to change the very definition of what constitutes a refugee. But doing so would take a move by Congress, given that the U.S. signed on to the current definition in the  Refugee Act of 1980 . \n A Legal Quagmire \n Rachel Levitan, who works on strategy and planning for refugee aid organization HIAS, said \u201cYou\u2019d have to amend the constitution\u201d to prioritize Christian refugees for resettlement \u2015 at least as an institutionalized policy. \n There isn\u2019t a precedent for prioritizing certain religious groups over others for resettlement. But there is a precedent for singling out certain religious and ethnic groups based on fear and xenophobia. During WWII, thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of the Holocaust were  denied entry to the U.S.  based on fears of Nazi spying. Also during that time, more than a hundred thousand Japanese-Americans were  forced into internment camps  over paranoia that they might sabotage American war efforts. \n We\u2019re witnessing similar fears over Muslim immigration to the U.S. today. \n If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  January 30, 2017 \n \n Elizabeth Hurd, a political science professor at Northwestern University, noted that in  today\u2019s xenophobic climate , \u201cMuslim identity is assumed to be attached to people\u2019s political allegiances, rendering them suspect to the state.\u201d \n Trump and his aides claimed the travel ban wasn\u2019t intended to discriminate against Muslims, but the president\u2019s  rhetoric and track-record  brought the motives behind the executive order into question. \n Legally, the order appeared to pose a violation to the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which says, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d Essentially, the government cannot enact laws that could be seen as favoring any religion over another. \n As Hurd noted in an  op-ed for The Washington Post , the government would have to identify who is Christian and who is not in order to prioritize these refugees, making the administration a kind of arbiter of centuries-long theological debates. \n The Notorious \u2018Religion Test\u2019 \n Verifying a person\u2019s religious affiliation can be simple \u2015 as in the case of a refugee who possesses a state-issued identification card (which in many countries  indicates a person\u2019s religion .) But it can also be very complicated. If the refugee had to flee their home quickly, they might not have ID cards or other documents on hand to prove that they belong to a certain faith group and have been persecuted for it, Levitan said. In these cases, refugee and asylum officers might have to do some detective work.\u00a0 \n \u201cThe asylum officers are trained to identify where the stories break down \u2015 geographically, contextually, from a familial standpoint. There\u2019s a whole set of considerations people look to,\u201d Andrew Free, an immigration attorney in Tennessee, told HuffPost. Sometimes this focus on consistency can cost people, Free said, for instance if a person married outside their sect. \n \n The government would end up implicitly having to define the boundaries and borders of the religion in order to decide who would be in and who would be out.\" \n \n\n But as Megan Brewer, an immigration attorney and former asylum officer with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, noted: \u201cAs an officer you can never be informed enough about all the religions and subgroups.\u201d \n There may be other ways to determine a person\u2019s faith. Depending on the country they come from, their name or clothing may indicate what religious group they belong to. \u201cOtherwise we might ask about behavior or how they practice their religion,\u201d Brewer said. \n \n \t \n \n In some cases, religiosity may be conflated with religious expertise, as it was for asylum seekers in the UK in recent years. A  nonpartisan report  released last summer revealed that UK Home Office officials had occasionally taken to quizzing applicants on \u201cBible trivia.\u201d Interviewers sometimes asked Christians to recite the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer, name the apostles, or explain the meaning of Lent. \n Not all Christians know the answers to these questions, and not all Christian denominations emphasize this kind of knowledge.

People with no apparent ties to California were friending the page and sharing links from unfamiliar sites full of anti- Hillary Clinton  propaganda. \n The stories they posted weren\u2019t the normal complaints he was used to seeing as the Vermont senator and the former secretary of state fought out the  Democratic presidential primary . These stories alleged that Clinton had murdered her political opponents and used body doubles. \n Mattes, 66,  had been a television reporter  and Senate investigator in previous lives. He put his expertise in unmasking fraudsters to work. At first, he suspected that the sites were created by the old Clinton haters from the \u201890s \u2015 what Hillary Clinton had dubbed \u201cthe vast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d \n But when Mattes started tracking down the sites\u2019 domain registrations, the trail led to Macedonia and Albania. In mid-September, he emailed a few of his private investigator friends with a list of the sites. \u201cVery creepy and i do not think Koch brothers,\u201d he wrote. \n Mattes and his friends didn\u2019t know what to make of his findings. He couldn\u2019t get his mind around the possibility that trolls overseas might be trying to sway a bunch of Southern Californians who supported Sanders\u2019 run for president. \u201cI may be a dark cynic and I may have been an investigative reporter for a long time, but this was too dark \u2015 and too unbelievable and most upsetting,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was I to do with this?\u201d \n By late October, Mattes said he\u2019d traced 40 percent of the domain registrations for the fake news sites he saw popping up on pro-Sanders pages back to Eastern Europe. Others appeared to be based in Panama and the U.S., or were untraceable. He wondered, \u201cAm I the only person that sees all this crap floating through these Bernie pages?\u201d \n He wasn\u2019t. Bernie supporters across the country had been noticing dubious websites and posters linked back to Eastern Europe long before Mattes did \u2015 and even before The Washington Post  reported in mid-June  that Russian government hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee. They had been warning each other that something weird was going on, posting troll alerts and compiling lists of fake news sites. \n There is enough real news to fight over, they thought, without arguing over anti-Hillary conspiracy theories from Macedonia. \n\n \n \n \nStephen Lam/Reuters\n \n \nBernie Sanders' supporters started seeing fake news in early 2016.\n \n \n\n\n Sometimes it was hard to tell who was doing the trolling and for what purposes.\u00a0Aleta Pearce, 54, who lives in Malibu, California, was an administrator of half a dozen pro-Sanders Facebook groups and a member of many others. In May 2016, she posted a memo to various Facebook groups about the fake news issue, warning of bogus sites. \n \u201cThe pattern I\u2019m seeing is if a member is repeatedly posting articles that are only from one URL that person is just there to push advertising,\u201d Pearce wrote. \u201cThey probably have a sock account with little to no content. They are often from Russia or Macedonia.\u201d (A \u201csock\u201d or \u201csock puppet\u201d account uses a false identity to deceive.) \n Pearce added, \u201cPlease share this with other Bernie groups so we can put an end to this spam bombing that\u2019s filling up our pages and groups. It\u2019s time to chase the mice out of the hen house and send them a message. They don\u2019t know who they are messing with.\u201d \n The first tidal wave of spam was mostly anti-Bernie, Pearce recalled, posted by Clinton backers. (David Brock\u2019s Clinton-backing super PAC had likely  paid for some portion of those .) But after Clinton became the Democratic nominee in July, Pearce noticed a switch to anti-Hillary messages with links to fake news and to real news with obnoxious pop-up ads. \n \u201cEvery site publishing those \u2015 you clicked on the article, you would be slammed with ads and strange articles,\u201d Pearce told HuffPost. \u201cIt was overwhelming. It was 24/7.\u201d \n She kept a list of fake news sites to watch for \u2015 it grew into dozens. There were posts on the Clinton-has-Parkinson\u2019s conspiracy and the Clinton-is-running-a-pedophilia-ring-out-of-a-pizza-shop conspiracy. \n On the Sanders campaign, it was Hector Sigala\u2019s job to connect with all the organic Facebook groups. He recalled seeing \u201ca lot of trolls\u201d try to convince people of something \u201cthat was obviously fake.\u201d \n Many of the interlopers, Sigala said, claimed to be Sanders fans who had decided to vote for GOP nominee Donald Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the general election and tried to convince others to do likewise. \u201cIt made it seem like the community as a whole was supporting that, but that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d he said. \n Sigala thinks most of them were just your average internet trolls. He said he found many were members of 4chan, a gathering place for the alt-right, white nationalists and plain old nihilists from which has sprung all manner of mischief. \n The Sanders campaign had begun seeing this particular brand of fake news starting in early 2016. \u201cThe first time that we kind of fell for it, for like two minutes, was this link from what seemed to be ABC News,\u201d Sigala said. It turned out to be ABC.com.co, a fake site that has no affiliation with the real news network. It had \u201creported\u201d that the pope himself had endorsed Sanders. \n \n It came in like a wave, like a tsunami. It was like a flood of misinformation. \n Bev Cowling, who administered Facebook groups for Sanders supporters \n \n\n In trying to wade through the flood of fake news, Sanders supporters had some serious trust issues. There was good reason to be skeptical of Clinton and the WikiLeaks dump of DNC emails was real, after all. But a steady diet of stories fabricated out of thin air can also feed into paranoia and flame wars. \n Bev Cowling, 64, saw a sudden deluge of requests to join the Sanders Facebook groups she administered from her home in Toney, Alabama. All of a sudden, they were getting 80 to 100 requests to join each day. She and the other administrators couldn\u2019t vet everyone, and the posts started getting bizarre. \u201cIt came in like a wave, like a tsunami,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like a flood of misinformation.\u201d \n Cowling, a retired postal worker, said some of her Facebook group members were ready to believe the bogus news links. \u201cPeople were so anti-Hillary that no matter what you said, they were willing to share it and spread it,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first I would just laugh about it. I would say, \u2018C\u2019mon, this is beyond ridiculous.\u2019 I created a word called \u2018ridiculosity.\u2019 I would say, \u2018This reeks of ridiculosity.\u2019\u201d \n But Cowling got pushback. She was called a \u201cHillbot\u201d and a Trump supporter. She ended up removing dozens of members who refused to stop pushing conspiracy theories. \u201cI lost quite a few friends,\u201d she said. \n Matthew Smollon, a 34-year-old copy editor and page designer based in Knoxville, Tennessee, noticed an influx of posts linking to fake news as early as January 2016. So much of it, Smollon noticed, came from the same accounts. Almost all the sites he traced went back to Veles, Macedonia, which Wired magazine has since dubbed the \u201c Fake News Factory to the World .\u201d There wasn\u2019t a single link he found that went to a pro-Clinton fake news story. \n None of the fake stories stood out to Smollon. He described the Facebook groups as \u201cbeing in a room filled with blasting televisions.\u201d It was hard to pick out the loudest noises. \u201cThe ultimate goal of this wasn\u2019t so much misinformation as distraction from valid info,\u201d he concluded. \n But Smollon had a hard time convincing other Bernie supporters that they were being played. \u201cNo one cared,\u201d Smollon said. \u201cAt that point, you were a Hillary shill. It was like an echo chamber of anger.\u201d \n Even when pointing out that something like NBCPolitics.org was a fake site \u2015 the real site is NBCNews.com/politics \u2015 he drew criticism. He was eventually removed as a moderator from one of the pro-Sanders Facebook groups. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve been to being gaslit in my life,\u201d he said. \n In June, Smollon  posted a piece  on Medium with the headline, \u201cDear Bernie Supporters: Stop sharing posts from dumpster fire websites.\u201d He urged his fellow Sanders fans to wake up: \n \n Guys, I sincerely love you. I love your passion. I love your fire. I love all of that. But when 400 people are circle-jerking clickbait links in between wondering how Hillary Clinton is behind the FEMA Earthquake drill that happens on several days with one of them being primary day? \n Holy shit. \n You are allowing yourselves to be manipulated. Through the practice of taking anything that agrees with your opinion at face value, actively refusing to believe anything but what agrees with your narrative and following that up with blatant disregard for doing two minutes of searching to verify the information: you become the myopic Trump supporter that you so vocally loathe. \n \n Some people \u201cliked\u201d his Medium piece on Facebook and posted it on their walls, he said. Others did not. Smollon later updated his article to say he\u2019d been banned from the group \u201cBernie Believers\u201d because of it. \n \u201cThis is a pretty solid case for admins/mods being part of the spam,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot all of them obviously, but it only takes one person running with an ulterior motive to ensure the whole thing goes to shit.\u201d \n\n \n \n \nScreenshot\n \n \nA Facebook user named\u00a0Oliver Mitov posted dubious news links about Hillary Clinton.\n \n \n\n\n In San Diego, Mattes was intrigued by a Facebook user named \u201cOliver Mitov\u201d whom he saw constantly posting anti-Clinton propaganda. \n Mattes first noticed Mitov posting in his Facebook group in September. But when he searched the page\u2019s archives, he found that Mitov had been in the group since late July. He soon realized there wasn\u2019t just one Mitov but four. Three had Sanders as their profile picture. Two had the same single Facebook friend, while a third had no Facebook friends. The fourth appeared to be a middle-aged man with 19 Facebook friends, including that one friend the other Mitovs had in common. \n All combined, the four Mitovs had joined more than two dozen pro-Sanders groups around the U.S., including Latinos for Bernie Sanders, Oregon for Bernie Sanders 2016 and Pennsylvania Progressives for Bernie Sanders. Together, those groups had hundreds of thousands of members. \n The Mitov posts would have been explosive if they\u2019d been true. In one Aug. 4 post to Mattes\u2019 page, Mitov wrote, \u201cThis is a story you won\u2019t see on Fox/CNN or the other Mainstream media!\u201d He then linked to a post claiming falsely that Clinton had \u201cmade a small fortune by arming ISIS.\u201d On Sept. 25, he posted on several pro-Sanders pages a link promising game-changing information: \u201cNEW LEAK: Here is Who Ordered Hillary To Leave The 4 Men In Benghazi!\u201d The link went to a fake news site called usapoliticsnow.com. \n The aim of Mitov\u2019s activity seemed pretty obvious to Mattes: to depress the number of Sanders supporters who voted for Clinton in November. \n \u201cHe was a ringer,\u201d Mattes said. \n Mattes tried to friend the various Mitovs and message them. None of them responded, he said. Attempts by HuffPost to reach Mitov were similarly unsuccessful. \n\n \n \n \nScreenshot\n \n \nMitov's long list of pro-Sanders\u00a0Facebook pages shows no\u00a0other outside interests.\n \n \n\n\n Keegan Goudiss had a different perspective on the trolling. As head of the digital side of Sanders\u2019 presidential bid, Goudiss launched paid campaigns on social media and around the internet, so he was very familiar with the way that money can drive a meme. \n Bots and trolls that spread fake news shouldn\u2019t be ignored, he said, but \u201cit\u2019s like pissing in the ocean. There\u2019s a lot of noise online.\u201d One way to help your message cut through the noise is to spend money with Facebook, Google or an ad targeting platform that spreads links all over the internet, often at the bottom of stories. (Scroll down far enough on this page and you\u2019ll probably see some of them.) \n Goudiss recalled one telling example of how this worked: A Clinton ad appeared in the middle of a row of links, clearly paid for by a pro-Clinton group targeting potential donors and voters. To its left was a story making bogus claims about an illegitimate Clinton child. To its right was a piece on presidential mistresses. \u201cThere seems to have been a concerted effort to tarnish Hillary and people in her campaign\u2019s reputation using paid placement,\u201d he said. \n\n \n \n \nScreenshot\n \n \nThis screenshot captured by Keegan Goudiss during the campaign shows fake news to the left, Clinton fundraising in the middle and an anti-Clinton story to the right.\n \n \n\n\n He can\u2019t prove who was doing that, Goudiss said, but it\u2019s probably worth trying to figure out. \n \u201cWas there a Russian entity supporting those websites that popped up?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s important and people deserve to know who influences our democracy.\u201d \n Some level of foreign participation in spreading disinformation about the left was comically apparent. The names of a few suspect Facebook groups reek of poor translation. One group with more than 80,000 members, claiming to be from Burlington, Vermont, is called \u201cBernie Sanders Lovers\u201d \u2015 the kind of name a non-English speaker might think makes sense, but that sounds wrong to native ears. \n\n \n \n \nScreenshot\n \n \n\n\n Throughout the campaign, the Bernie Sanders Lovers page saw heavy engagement, and nearly every article it shared was from Bients.com, the pieces posted there by one Maximilian Gottlieb. Gottlieb, in turn, pulled articles from other sources, some more and some less reliable. \n On Oct. 29, for instance, he put up 11 articles. A few praised Trump or gave Trump\u2019s advisers space to attack Clinton. Others attacked Clinton\u2019s campaign directly: adviser Huma Abedin had ties to radical Islam (false), the DNC email leak was authentic (true), campaign manager Robby Mook had deleted his entire Twitter feed (false). \n Since the election, the Bernie Sanders Lovers page has shifted to urging the senator to run for president again in 2020. It no longer shares Bients.com stories. Instead, they all come from ThePredicted.com.\u00a0Both sites were registered by a person name Hysen Alimi in Albania. (Feel free to check out the sites yourself, but Chrome will warn you your connection is \u201cnot secure,\u201d so don\u2019t enter any information there.) \n\n \n \n \nScreenshot\n \n \nA day of posts from\u00a0Maximilian Gottlieb.\n \n \n\n\n There had been rumblings that the Russians were specifically behind the DNC hack since last June. In early October, the U.S. intelligence community  said it was \u201cconfident\u201d  that President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government had both directed the hack and made sure the emails found their way to WikiLeaks. In January of this year, a  more detailed intelligence report  concluded that the Russian government had blended covert intelligence operations with overt efforts by, among others, \u201cpaid social media users or \u2018trolls\u2019\u201d to try to influence the U.S. election. \n A separate dossier on Russia\u2019s role, assembled by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele and  made public by BuzzFeed , claimed that the DNC leak had been an attempt to \u201cswing supporters of Bernie Sanders away from Hillary Clinton and across to Trump.\u201d \n \u201cThese voters were perceived as activists and anti-status quo and anti-establishment and in that regard sharing many features with the Trump campaign, including a visceral dislike of Clinton,\u201d Steele wrote. \n The intelligence report also said that the DNC hackers seemed to have financial ties to the Internet Research Agency, a Saint Petersburg, Russia, company that has taken state-sponsored trolling to an industrial level. Its likely financier is \u201ca close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence,\u201d the report stated. \n \u201cRussia\u2019s information war might be thought of as the biggest trolling operation in history,\u201d wrote The New York Times in a 2015 profile of the firm, \u201cand its target is nothing less than the utility of the Internet as a democratic space.\u201d \n The \u201cInternet as a democratic space\u201d is the very thing that allowed the energy of the Sanders campaign to snowball into a movement for change. It was also the thing that allowed Oliver Mitov and his ilk to thrive. \n Could the fake news tsunami have swung the election? It\u2019s impossible to say for sure, but a YouGov survey recently\u00a0 asked people who voted for Sanders in the primary \u00a0how they thought other people they knew who backed Sanders ended up voting in the general election. Thirteen percent said all of those folks voted for Clinton, and 48 percent said most of them did. But 20 percent said only some, 9 percent said just a few and 4 percent said none voted for Clinton. \n In the survey, only 7 percent said that most or all of the Bernie people they knew wound up helping raise money or otherwise volunteering for Clinton. Fifty-four percent said that applied to just a few or none of the Bernie people they knew. Sanders backers were by far the most energized element of the Democratic coalition during last year\u2019s campaign. Clinton\u2019s inability to motivate them more broadly to back her candidacy undoubtedly hurt. \n Asked what they themselves did, 12 percent of those who voted for Sanders said they went on to volunteer or raise money for Clinton. Only 16 percent of those who voted for Clinton in the primary said they also volunteered for her. \n Of course, the propaganda didn\u2019t create the chasm dividing left-wing voters. The belief that the DNC favored Clinton was widely held. Fifty-eight percent of all the survey respondents agreed on that. Among Democrats, the number was 55 percent. In the Midwest, which essentially elected Trump president, 67 percent agreed. Even 62 percent of those who voted for Clinton in the primary said that the DNC favored her. \n But the legitimate skepticism opened the door to believing the more demented propaganda. And the more the fake news was passed around, the harder the divisions became. Clinton backers would charge Sanders supporters with being obnoxious, sexist \u201cBernie bros.\u201d Many of those bros may have been trolls, not real Sanders supporters. Tell that to a Clinton backer, however, and you can be accused of dismissing the hostility they faced. \n Aidan King set up a popular Reddit page for Sanders beginning in 2013 and went to work for the campaign in January 2016 as Sigala\u2019s deputy. He dealt directly with many of the Facebook groups. After the Democratic convention, he said he noticed a strong shift away from the party in the tone of many of those pages. \n \u201cI\u2019ve gone back and forth on it,\u201d King said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable saying with any authority it\u2019s a coordinated effort by trolls, but also wouldn\u2019t feel confident saying it was exclusively pissed-off Bernie supporters.\u201d\u00a0 \n It might not actually matter if Vladimir Putin or a kid in Macedonia masterminded the flood of fake news. What matters is that it happened \u2015 and it is still happening. People are deliberately seeding misinformation into the left-wing conversation. That\u2019s a real fact.\u00a0(Trying to\u00a0 measure the size and scope  of the operation could make for a useful political science dissertation.) \n For a wide swath of Sanders backers, the primary is still far too raw to even start to think about Russia. Mentioning foreign sabotage sounds like you\u2019re throwing up a smokescreen to obscure the Democratic establishment\u2019s own failure. But Mattes has tried to argue that two things can be true at once: Clinton was a terrible candidate  and \u00a0Russia intervened in the U.S. election. \n \u201cIt\u2019s wildly distressing that we were played,\u201d Mattes said.\u00a0 \n After reading this story, we\u2019re curious what your view is on Russia\u2019s role in the election.  Take this brief survey , and we\u2019ll post the results here on Sunday night. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "The trolls set out to distract and divide the invigorated left.", "title": "The Bernie Sanders Campaign Faced A Fake News Tsunami.

Along the way, he\u2019s embraced roles as a brash businessman, a playboy and an entertainer, all while offering us a clear window into his psyche. \n Trump\u2019s exposure has made him both respected and reviled.\u00a0By now, you probably know his controversial comments about  women \u00a0or  Latinos . Some people love him for them. Others despise him. But however you feel about what Trump has said, written or done, there\u2019s no denying that he\u2019s defined his own character\u00a0\u2015 and it\u2019s something never before seen on the presidential stage. \n Decency, devotion and grace have been big themes at the Democratic National Convention this week, and it\u2019s no secret why. Democrats believe these are winning qualities, which exemplify key differences between Trump and Hillary Clinton \u2015 or pretty much any other person who has endeavored to occupy the highest office in the nation.\u00a0Whatever you think of Trump\u2019s fitness for the Oval Office, he has not exactly gone out of his way to convince the public that he would be a caring and thoughtful president fully devoted to the momentous task of leading the nation. \n To get a better sense of what sets Trump apart from other presidents, we only need to take a look at the person he is seeking to replace. The quotes below don\u2019t say much about where President Barack Obama and Trump differ on specific policies.\u00a0But they do paint contrasting portraits of two men.\u00a0One evidently an articulate, intellectually curious leader who has given careful consideration to a variety of topics spanning politics and culture. The other ... well, we\u2019ll just let his words speak for themselves. \n Obama on his daughters and beauty: \n In an  interview with Time  earlier this year, Obama gave his thoughts on unfair beauty standards for women, and how he and his wife Michelle deal with that as parents. \n \u201cWhen I was a kid I didn\u2019t realize ... the enormous pressure that young women are placed under in terms of looking a certain way. And being cute in a certain way,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAre you wearing the right clothes? And is your hair done the right way? And that pressure, I think, is historically always been harder on African American women than just about any other women. But it\u2019s part and parcel of a broader way in which we socialize and press women to constantly doubt themselves or define themselves in terms of a certain appearance. And so Michelle and I are always guarding against that. And the fact that they\u2019ve got a tall gorgeous mom who has some curves, and that their father appreciates, I think is helpful.\u201d \n\n \n \n \nKevin Mazur via Getty Images\n \n \n(L-R) Malia Obama, Sasha Obama, President Barack Obama, and First Lady Michelle Obama speak onstage at TNT Christmas in Washington in 2014.\n \n \n\n\n Trump on his daughter and beauty: \n During a  2006 appearance  on \u201cThe View,\u201d Trump talked about how hot his daughter is. Then things quickly got weirder. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think Ivanka would do that [pose for nude photographs] inside the magazine,\u201d said Trump. \u201cAlthough she does have a very nice figure. I\u2019ve said that if Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps, I would be dating her. Is that terrible?\u201d \n \n Obama on his wife and being a partner: \n Speaking with  Parade in 2014 , Obama reflected on the difficulties couples can face in successfully balancing work and home life.\u00a0 \n \n We were talking earlier about the strains on the family with two parents working and young children at home. I want to be absolutely clear: Michelle bore far greater burdens than I did. But I think she\u2019ll also admit that I really love being a dad. \n When men don\u2019t have work, when they don\u2019t feel good about being able to support their families, then often they detach themselves.\u00a0The children then don\u2019t have a male presence in the home. And the mother, no matter how heroic she is, now is on her own, which puts more strain on her. \n So, part of the challenge here is to say to young men, \u2018Take responsibility for your children.\u2019 But part of it is also, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019ve got an economy in which they feel as if they\u2019re attached to the workplace, and bringing home a paycheck. \n \n Trump on wives and being a partner: \n Here\u2019s Trump\u2019s more cynical take from  Trump: The Art of the Comeback. \n \u201cOften, I will tell friends whose wives are constantly nagging them about this or that that they\u2019re better off leaving and cutting their losses,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not a great believer in always trying to work things out, because it just doesn\u2019t happen that way. For a man to be successful he needs support at home, just like my father had from my mother, not someone who is always griping and bitching. When a man has to endure a woman who is not supportive and complains constantly about his not being home enough or not being attentive enough, he will not be very successful unless he is able to cut the cord.\u201d \u00a0 \n\n \n \n \nEvan Agostini/Invision/AP\n \n \nDonald Trump and wife Melania Trump attend the TIME 100 Gala on Tuesday, April 26, 2016.\n \n \n\n\n Obama on being black in America: \n In 2013, shortly after a jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, Obama delivered candid remarks about the daily racism many black Americans face. \n \n There are very few African American men in this country who haven\u2019t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.\u00a0There are very few African American men who haven\u2019t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me \u2015 at least before I was a senator. There are very few African Americans who haven\u2019t had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often. \n And I don\u2019t want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida. \n And it\u2019s inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear. The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws \u2015 everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws. And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case. \n \n Trump on being black in America: \n Someone apparently decided it was necessary to include Trump in a 1989 NBC News special on race.  This was his contribution . \n \u201cA well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market,\u201d he said. \u201cI think sometimes a black may think they don\u2019t have an advantage or this and that... I\u2019ve said on one occasion, even about myself, if I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I believe they do have an actual advantage today.\u2019\u2019 \n Here\u2019s a clip, via Mother Jones: \n \n Obama on the arts: \n Speaking in Vietnam earlier this year, the president  fielded a question  from a popular woman rapper who asked him about the role of arts and culture in a nation\u2019s progress. \n \n The arts are important. Artistic expression is important. It\u2019s what I was just saying to the filmmaker about stories that we tell each other. \u00a0Music, poetry, representations of life as it is and how it should be \u2015 those are the things that inspire people. Life is a combination of very practical things, right? You got to eat, you got to work, you got to build roads and make sure that some dam isn\u2019t ruining a community. But it\u2019s also the spirit that we have inside of us, and how is that expressed, and what are our vision and what are our ideals for the future, and how do we want to live together, and how do we treat each other. \n And one of the most important things about art is it teaches you to not just think about yourself, but it puts you in the head of other people. So you start realizing somebody else\u2019s pain, or somebody else\u2019s hopes. And you start realizing that we have more in common. So if I read a novel by somebody in Africa, now, suddenly, I understand more about how we are similar. \u00a0And if I listen to a Vietnamese rap, and it connects to the things that I\u2019m feeling, now I feel closer to a country on the other side of the world. And that\u2019s how we build understanding. And that\u2019s how we end up being able to work together and plan together and build a better future together. \n \n Read the rest of Obama\u2019s comments  here . \n Trump on the arts: \n It doesn\u2019t seem like Trump has thought quite as much about this topic. \n \u201cI punched my music teacher because I didn\u2019t think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled,\u201d he \u2015 or more likely his ghostwriter \u2015  wrote  in the 1987 book,  The Art of the Deal . \n While it\u2019s not entirely clear if that story is true, Trump voluntarily included the detail in his book.\u00a0He later told a biographer why this all might still be significant. \n \u201cWhen I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I\u2019m basically the same,\u201d\u00a0said Trump, in the book,  Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success . \u201cThe temperament is not that different.\u201d \n Obama on the military: \n In the midst of his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama, who didn\u2019t serve in the military,  delivered these remarks at a Memorial Day event  in Las Cruces, New Mexico. \n \n I speak to you today with deep humility. My grandfather marched in Patton\u2019s Army, but I cannot know what it is to walk into battle like so many of you. My grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line, but I cannot know what it is for a family to sacrifice like so many of yours have. \n I am the father of two young girls, and I cannot imagine what it is to lose a child. My heart breaks for the families who\u2019ve lost a loved one. \n These are things I cannot know. But there are also some things I do know. \n I know that our sadness today is mixed with pride; that those we\u2019ve lost will be remembered by a grateful nation; and that our presence here today is only possible because your loved ones, America\u2019s patriots, were willing to give their lives to defend our nation. \n \n Read the rest of Obama\u2019s prepared remarks  here . \n Trump on the military: \n Like Obama, Trump never served in the military. But according to Michael D\u2019Antonio\u2019s book  The Truth About Trump , he\u2019s repeatedly lied about how he avoided the Vietnam War. Here\u2019s  an excerpt : \n \n \u201cI actually got lucky because I had a very high draft number,\u201d [Trump] told a TV interviewer in 2011. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget, that was an amazing period of time in my life.\u201d In fact the lottery was not a factor in his experience. It didn\u2019t occur until fourteen months after he received his medical exemption [for heel spurs], and eighteen months after he\u2019d left Penn. \n [...] \n But Trump also insisted that he had actually known military life. In a separate conversation he said, \u201cI always thought I was in the military.\u201d He said that in prep school he received more military training than most actual soldiers did, and he had been required to live under the command of men such as Ted Dobias who had been real officers and soldiers. \u201cI felt like I was in the military in a true sense,\u201d added Trump, \u201c Because I dealt with the people.\u201d \n \n Obama on books and reading: \n In 2005, as a junior U.S. senator from Illinois, Obama  addressed the American Library Association \u00a0 Annual Conference  to extol the virtues of giving children access to knowledge through literacy. \n \u201cAt the dawn of the 21st century, where knowledge is literally power, where it unlocks the gates of opportunity and success, we all have responsibilities as parents, as librarians, as educators, as politicians, and as citizens to instill in our children a love of reading so that we can give them a chance to fulfill their dreams,\u201d he said. \n\n \n \n \nSAUL LOEB via Getty Images\n \n \nBarack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama read the book, 'Where the Wild Things Are,' during the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, March 28, 2016.\n \n \n\n\n Trump on books and reading: \n Trump is reportedly  not a very big fan of books . In an  interview with the Hollywood Reporter  earlier this year, he said he was reading a book written by an enemy of the Clintons, as well as a novel that most people read in middle school. \n \u201cI\u2019m reading the Ed Klein book on Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m reading the book on Richard Nixon that was, well, I\u2019ll get you the exact information on it. I\u2019m reading a book that I\u2019ve read before, it\u2019s one of my favorite books,  \u2018 All Quiet on the Western Front,\u2019 \u00a0which is one of the greatest books of all time.\u201d \n Obama on climate change: \n In 2014, Obama  delivered a commencement address  at the University of California, Irvine, in which he tore into the disturbing nature of the outright denial climate change skeptics often employ. \n \u201cPart of what\u2019s unique about climate change, though, is the nature of some of the opposition to action,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare that you\u2019ll encounter somebody who says the problem you\u2019re trying to solve simply doesn\u2019t exist. When President Kennedy set us on a course for the moon, there were a number of people who made a serious case that it wouldn\u2019t be worth it; it was going to be too expensive, it was going to be too hard, it would take too long. But nobody ignored the science. I don\u2019t remember anybody saying that the moon wasn\u2019t there or that it was made of cheese.\u201d \n Trump on climate change: \n Obama might as well have been talking about Trump. Though perhaps that\u2019s a generous interpretation of the GOP presidential nominee\u2019s stance on the issue. \n \u201c[W]e\u2019ve had times where the weather wasn\u2019t working out, so they changed it to extreme weather, and they have all different names, you know, so that it fits the bill. But the problem we have, and if you look at our energy costs, and all of the things that we\u2019re doing to solve a problem that I don\u2019t think in any major fashion exists,\u201d Trump said  during a radio interview last year . \u201cI mean, Obama thinks it\u2019s the number one problem of the world today. And I think it\u2019s very low on the list. So I am not a believer ... unless somebody can prove something to me, I believe there\u2019s weather. I believe there\u2019s change, and I believe it goes up and it goes down, and it goes up again. And it changes depending on years and centuries, but I am not a believer, and we have much bigger problems.\u201d \n Obama on political correctness: \n Speaking at a town hall in 2015, the president  weighed in on the issue of liberal political correctness  and censorship, particularly regarding its ability to squelch free speech and expression on college campuses. \n \n It\u2019s not just sometimes folks who are mad that colleges are too liberal that have a problem. Sometimes there are folks on college campuses who are liberal, and maybe even agree with me on a bunch of issues, who sometimes aren\u2019t listening to the other side, and that\u2019s a problem too. I\u2019ve heard some college campuses where they don\u2019t want to have a guest speaker who is too conservative or they don\u2019t want to read a book if it has language that is offensive to African-Americans or somehow sends a demeaning signal towards women. I gotta tell you, I don\u2019t agree with that either. \n I don\u2019t agree that you, when you become students at colleges, have to be coddled and protected from different points of view.\u00a0 think you should be able to \u2014 anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with, you should have an argument with \u2018em. But you shouldn\u2019t silence them by saying, \u2018You can\u2019t come because I\u2019m too sensitive to hear what you have to say.\u2019 That\u2019s not the way we learn either. \n \n Trump on political correctness: \n Trump doesn\u2019t like political correctness because it is bad. \n \u201cI think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. I\u2019ve been challenged by so many people, and I don\u2019t frankly have time for total political correctness,\u201d he said  during a GOP presidential debate last year . \u201cAnd to be honest with you, this country doesn\u2019t have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don\u2019t win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody.\u201d \n\n \n \n \nJohn Moore via Getty Images\n \n \nDonald Trump jeers the media in front a crowd of supporters on July 27, 2016 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n \n \n\n\n Trump on handshakes: \n Oh boy, does Trump hate shaking people\u2019s hands. \n \u201cOne of the curses of American society is the simple act of shaking hands, and the more successful and famous one becomes the worse this terrible custom seems to get,\u201d he wrote in his 1997 book,  T he Art of the Comeback. \u00a0\u201cI happen to be a clean hands freak. I feel much better after I thoroughly wash my hands, which I do as much as possible.\u201d \n Did we mention, he\u2019s not a big fan of the handshake? \n \u201cBut, you know, I am not a big fan of the handshake. I think it\u2019s barbaric,\u201d he told \u201cDateline\u201d in 1999. \u201cThey have medical reports all the time. Shaking hands, you catch colds, you catch the flu, you catch it, you catch all sorts of things. Who knows what you don\u2019t catch?\u201d \n Obama on handshakes: \n As far we can tell, the president hasn\u2019t spoken publicly about his opinion on shaking people\u2019s hands, but we know he\u2019s familiar with a few different kinds of greetings. \n\n \n \n \nScott Olson via Getty Images\n \n \nBarack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama bump fists after clinching the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008.\n \n \n\n\n Thank you for all you've done for this campaign, and all you'll do in the next 36 days to win this.  pic.twitter.com/rjHIjhMf \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama)  October 1, 2012 \n \n\n \n \n \nJIM WATSON via Getty Images\n \n \nObama fist bumps with 4-year-old Luca Martinez as he departs the White House in Washington, D.C., May 2, 2015.\n \n \n\n\n And we\u2019ll just leave you with this. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "So much for \"the best words.\"", "title": "We Compared Obama's Words To Trump's And The Result Will Make You Sad | The Huffington Post"}

Scores more protested outside. Issa\u00a0 hosted two meetings \u00a0to accommodate some of the crowd. \n As the audience became increasingly angry, the nine-term congressman quipped: \u201cI don\u2019t mind that things are contentious. I just don\u2019t want things to end like the play \u2018Hamilton\u2019\u201d\u2014 but voters weren\u2019t laughing. \n At both meetings, voters voiced concerns about the elimination of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. When Issa refused to say \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cnot affordable\u201d he was met with a crescendo of jeers and chants of, \u201cDo your job.\u201d \n Issa drew rare applause when he said that, unlike many of his fellow Republicans, he had called for an investigation into\u00a0 Russia\u2019s interference into the presidential campaign , CBS 8-TV reported.\u00a0He also vowed to oppose the defunding of the EPA. \n Hunter, whose larger town hall in Ramona attracted some 1,000 protesters, was at times confrontational, singing a line from Queens\u2019 \u201c We Are the Champions ,\u201d the San Diego Union Tribune reported. \n He said he would not support any investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, adding that the current U.S. intelligence community is packed with \u201cseditious Obama folks\u201d who \u201chate Donald Trump as much as you do\u201d and are trying to sabotage the administration. \n Hunter did try to assuage the angry crowd over Obamacare, saying he\u2019s not \u201ccompletely satisfied\u201d with the proposed replacement, but he believes it will be less expensive and therefore more accessible. \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe in guaranteed healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in guaranteed access to healthcare that people can afford.\u201d \n The GOP officials were forced to hold town hall meetings after protesters gathered this week outside their respective offices demanding they appear in public. \n California Democratic representatives Susan Davis\u00a0(D-Calif.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.) also held public meetings Saturday where they were\u00a0 pressed by voters \u00a0to hold the Trump administration to account.\u00a0 \n\n \n Related Coverage \n \n \n In a swing district, Issa feels the heat, and sees the light \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "\"Do your job!\"", "title": "Republican Congressmen Torched At Angry Town Hall Meetings In California | The Huffington Post"}

The time between your head hitting the pillow and your alarm going off gets squeezed until there\u2019s little of it left.\u00a0 Then you get up and do it again.  \n Doing all that to win is one thing. Doing it just to get wiped out at the polls requires a level of dedication bordering on bonkers.  \n That means that one of the first questions top potential candidates ask party handlers before making the decision is a simple one: \u201cCan I win? If so, show me the numbers.\u201d \n But a funny thing is happening this time around:  Democratic  prospects, in conversations with party elders, are skipping that question. Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that the question of how winnable a race is is often among the top concerns. This year, the energy among Democratic activists has persuaded potential candidates that anything is possible. \n \u201cSo far, this cycle is very different,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are coming to us in a way that\u2019s new and exciting, and it\u2019s clear that we will have strong candidates across an expanded battlefield in 2018.\u201d \n Finding good candidates has been even easier this year than it was in 2016,\u00a0bucking a years-long trend.  \n \u201cDespite the fact that presidential cycles tend to benefit Democrats in terms of turnout, recruitment was not easy last cycle,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOur political department ultimately recruited a number of strong, successful candidates, but it was only after camping out in districts and going person to person, sometimes for months, until they found someone qualified and interested in running.\u201d \n It started with the  Women\u2019s March \u00a0events in January, when  around 4 million people \u00a0took to the streets around the country, for the  largest single-day rally  in American history. It continued with surging turnout in special elections from Minnesota to Iowa to Virginia,  Connecticut  and  Delaware . It has flowed down to Georgia, where a 30-year-old Democrat, Jon Ossoff, is attempting to take Republican Tom Price\u2019s House seat. Ossoff is  breaking fundraising records \u00a0thanks to a burst of small-dollar support from around the country. And now in Montana,  Rob Quist , a bluegrass legend, has jumped into the race for the Democrats to fill the seat vacated by Ryan Zinke, who, like Price, joined President\u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s \u00a0cabinet.\u00a0 \n Quist has a long history of public service and charitable work and is wildly popular in Montana, but he has never run for office. Trump has changed things. Groups that have exploded since the election, like  Swing Left ,  Flippable  and the  Sister District Project , are funneling money and volunteer resources from blue districts to where it\u2019s needed more. \n Democrats have been bad at getting out their base in recent midterm elections\u00a0\u2015 although history is on their side this time around, since the party in control of the White House traditionally suffers losses in these off-year elections. But with  midterm turnout low , the best candidates often take a pass at making a bid. Without good candidates, turnout falls lower, accelerating a vicious cycle. \n The Democratic Party is face an uphill climb  in the Senate in general, but particularly this year: Democrats are defending 25 of the 34 seats up for grabs. Winning the 218 seats needed to take back the House of Representatives is a daunting task as well, no matter how much energy is in the streets, because Republicans have used their power at the state level to redraw districts to favor them. The fact that Democrats tend to cluster in major cities also plays a role in sorting voters in a way that allows  Republicans to claim 55 percent  of the seats,  even though more people voted  for Democrats for Congress.  \n\n \n \n \nThe Outline\n \n \nDemocrats need to win well over a majority to control the House Senate and White House\n \n \n\n\n But Republicans can\u2019t gerrymander a state \u2015  and 36 states  have governors races in 2018. Those elections will be critical in helping to un-gerrymander the  damage  that was done after the 2010 census. Nine of those are in currently Republican-governed states that Democratic presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton  won in 2016, and at least another half dozen are well within reach. Another nine are currently held by Democrats.  \n The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already had more than 175 serious conversations or meetings with potential recruits in more than 55 districts \u2015 far more than in past cycles. The group said it\u2019s seeing more interest from veterans, who are concerned about Trump\u2019s views on national security and see running for office as a second call to duty. \n There\u2019s also been a surge of interest from people who have  never run for office  and now want to at least explore stepping up to the plate. This trend is happening even in GOP bastions like Utah and South Carolina. When the state party opened up registration for a March candidate training, officials  sold out  of their 50 tickets in the first day. A week later, the party expanded it to 200 spots \u2015 and again immediately sold out.  \n In a wave election, districts that are evenly split swing toward the party that is surging \u2015 Democrats in 2006 and 2008, then Republicans in 2010 \u2015 and districts that lean toward the majority party become winnable. In a district which went for Trump by 10 points, it\u2019s not hard to see how that becomes a tight race under the right circumstances. \n Mark Fraley, chairman of the Monroe County, Indiana Democratic Party, said that Democrats on the ground are fired up, and Republicans are checking out. Stephanie Hansen, who  won a Delaware special election  in February, saw the same thing, moving what was a two point race to an 18 point blowout.  \n \u201cIf our people are mobilized and Trump supporters are demoralized, then yes, some of these races that have nine-point Republican advantages start looking close,\u201d Fraley said. \u201cA lot of Trump\u2019s core supporters aren\u2019t going anywhere, but you start seeing demoralization among working people \u2015 they voted for Obama twice, then Trump. If we\u2019re not seeing the changes they hoped to see you\u2019ll be able to see disengagement on that part.\u201d \n There are, meanwhile, eight districts that could be easier picking for Democrats. These seats \u2015 one each in Arizona, New Jersey and Kansas, two in Texas and three in California \u2015 are all congressional districts that voted for the GOP presidential candidate in both 2008 and then 2012 \u2015 and then went for Hillary Clinton this past cycle. They\u2019re also all still represented by GOP House members. It won\u2019t be easy, of course. Texas\u2019s 7th district hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to Congress  since 1967 .  \n One of those seats is currently held by veteran congressman Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), an eccentric libertarian-leaning Republican who\u2019s been in office nearly 30 years. He faced his toughest challenge in 2008, but still won by some 10 points and hasn\u2019t faced a true challenge since. That changed this year, thanks in large part to the endless demonstrations local Democrats have held against Rohrabacher. \n \n The Women\u2019s March, coupled with the activist movement here ... was the biggest motivation that now is the time for all of us to get involved and be the change we want to see. \n Californian Democratic candidate Harley Rouda \n \n\n Local businessman  Harley Rouda , seeing the energy in the streets, decided to jump in and challenge Rohrabacher. \n  \u201cThe energy is what motivated me to get in the race, hands down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Women\u2019s March, coupled with the activist movement here ... was the biggest motivation that now is the time for all of us to get involved and be the change we want to see.\u201d \n It mattered to Rouda that, with the uptick in anti-Trump energy, the race seems winnable.  \n \u201cI\u2019ll be straight with you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that midterms don\u2019t typically draw voters out ... is tempered by the populist movement we\u2019ve got going here. Now is the time to tap into that crowd who really want to get engaged and committed to making that difference.\u201d \n In some rare cases, there may even be too much engagement. California has a top-two primary system, meaning the top two finishers, regardless of party, go on to compete in the general election, even if both are from the same party.  \n Christy Smith, a progressive  school board president  in the Los Angeles region, had her eye on California\u2019s 25th congressional district, a seat held tenuously by Republican Stephen Knight, but one carried in 2016 by Clinton. The DCCC in 2016 had backed Bryan Caforio, who raised a lot of money but never connected with voters and lost by six points. With the energy coursing through the district, a campaign began to draft Smithto jump in the race. He\u2019s popular with both supporters of Sen.  Bernie Sanders  (I-Vt.) and those who backed Clinton. Smith gave it a lot of thought, and when first interviewed by The Huffington Post this month, she was undecided. \u201cI was riding two horses with one ass,\u201d she joked a week later, having finally made up her mind to run for state assembly rather than Congress.  \n Her reasoning, she said, was two-fold.  \n \u201cCalifornia is on the leading edge of what\u2019s possible with effective government,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be able to be a part of that could be tremendous and allow me a lot of latitude to really get things done for people in my district and bring resources back.\u201d  \n Strategically, though, it was also the smarter move. \u201cWith all of this newfound energy, there\u2019s not a lot of understanding of strategy with those folks, because they\u2019re new to the game,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a broad \u2018y\u2019all come\u2019 attitude, with people coming out of the woodwork.\u201d  \n That\u2019s great when it comes to turnout, but California has a top-two system, meaning that the top two finishers in the primary, regardless of party, go on to the general election. If a big batch of Democrats run, then Republicans tend to run only two candidates. That can allow those two candidates to finish one and two, while Democrats split the remainder among themselves. That puts two Republicans on the general election ballot.  \n \u201cWe need to be smart if we\u2019re going to flip this district,\u201d she said. \n HuffPost Survey: Should Democrats in Congress resist Trump across the board, or work with him where there is common ground? \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "\u201cA lot of Trump\u2019s core supporters aren\u2019t going anywhere, but you start seeing demoralization among working people.\"", "title": "Anger At Donald Trump Could Break The Democrats' Midterm Curse | The Huffington Post"}

I wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d  \n Then she pulls a tray of traditional Buffalo wings out of the oven, inspiring one of these gourmets to say, \u201cNow those are some wings.\u201d \n Watch for yourself: \n \n But what makes it really offensive  is the way the segment is set up, Eater.com reports. \n \n Earlier in the episode, the Food Network Star explains that her husband loves classic Buffalo wings and she wants to pull a prank on him by serving an Asian iteration. \u201cI like to mess with my spouse, I can\u2019t help it,\u201d she says. The offensive conceit \u2015 that he and his college buddies would be revolted by Asian wings \u2015 was clearly written into the show before it was even filmed. \n \n The episode is nearly five years old, but it has gone viral since  Thick Dumpling Skin , a website dedicated to Asian-American issues, saw it and  shared the clip on Twitter and Facebook. \n The site\u2019s editors also pointed out  how Food Network does a really terrible job  of showcasing the cuisines of Asia, many of which are  justifiably recognized as among the world\u2019s greatest : \n \n There isn\u2019t a single show on the Food Network hosted by someone Asian, unless you count Iron Chef (and we don\u2019t). Why must we watch non-Asian cooks who can\u2019t pronounce \u201cSriracha\u201d and don\u2019t have a chopstick drawer show us how to make our own dishes? And how come, when they do, we have to watch as their entire family mocks it \u2015 like in this episode of The Pioneer Woman? \n \n Yes, it\u2019s possible that not everyone appreciates Asian food, but as anyone who remembers hearing all the bad sushi jokes on 1980s sitcoms should note, the cuisine you insult in one decade is  often the one you crave in the next. \n Many people think the segment represents a reprehensible undercurrent of xenophobia and racism and aren\u2019t holding back. \n I was already bummed by the lack of diversity on  @foodnetwork  Now  @thepioneerwoman  & co. are on there saying they don't trust \"asian\" food??  https://t.co/faWbgC6rBV \u2014 rebecca tran (@beckietran)  March 7, 2017 \n \n well OBViously that's the shitty joke that made it past  @FoodNetwork  programmers.  https://t.co/pRJrNjdAmi \u2014 Jenny Yang \ud83d\udc72\ud83d\udc72\ud83d\udc72 (@jennyyangtv)  March 7, 2017 \n \n the \"JUST KIDDING GUYS HERE'S THE WHITE PEOPLE CHICKEN WINGS\" at the end is really something  https://t.co/ZD9jOQBFSK \u2014 Alison Mah (@alisonmah)  March 7, 2017 \n \n \"Asian wings!\" \"I DON'T TRUST THEM\" \"J/K I wouldn't do that to you guys\"???

The Republican health care bill would roll back Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and also dramatically reform the way Medicaid works. \n States currently administer Medicaid with a commitment from the federal government, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars per year, to help pay for as many enrollees as might be eligible due to low income. The Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act would limit that open-ended commitment by capping federal funding for states based on the number of enrollees rather than the cost of their medical claims. \n As Ryan put it on Friday, \u201cWe are de-federalizing an entitlement, block granting it back to the states, and capping its growth rate. That\u2019s never been done before.\u201d \n Indeed, the legislation\u2019s per capita funding caps have never been tried in a public benefit program,  according \u00a0to the Center for Law and Social Policy, a liberal think tank that generally opposes cutting antipoverty funds. Conservative policy wonks  have argued  that Medicaid\u2019s funding formula doesn\u2019t improve poor people\u2019s health in part because of low compensation rates for doctors.  \n But Congress has done \u201cblock granting\u201d before, just not on such a large scale. In 1996, amid a national debate over welfare fraud and the alleged pathologies of poor people, Congress overhauled the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, which since the 1930s had offered monthly cash benefits to single mothers and families in poverty. Congress renamed the program the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and capped its funding as a $16 billion \u201cblock grant\u201d to states. Ryan was a congressional staffer at the time.  \n \u201cWelfare reform is a $16 billion program,\u201d Ryan said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about trillions in the end here in this program.\u201d  \n Key features of welfare reform included time limits on benefits and a requirement that recipients engage in \u201cwork activities\u201d to remain enrolled. The real value of the program\u2019s $16 billion block grant has eroded with inflation, and enrollment in the program, in absolute numbers and as a percentage of eligible families, has fallen significantly. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  estimates  that as of 2014, only 23 percent of families in poverty received TANF benefits, down from 68 percent in 1997.  \n As the number of people on welfare has declined, conservatives have touted the reduction in childhood poverty and increases in workforce participation among women, though it\u2019s hard to disentangle the law\u2019s effects from broader economic forces. \n A key difference between welfare reform and the new Republican proposal for Medicaid is that the latter\u2019s per capita funding caps would be indexed to inflation and most of the reforms wouldn\u2019t phase in for another several years. Nevertheless, early estimates suggest the overall policy would have similar results:  fewer people  getting help from the program. \u00a0 \n Following reports last month that congressional Republicans were considering block grants for Medicaid \u2015 Ryan has long advocated block granting social programs \u2015 the Center for Law and Social Policy  produced an analysis   portraying TANF as a cautionary tale. The report said the program\u2019s policies vary widely across states and that, in general, it responded poorly to increased poverty as a result of the Great Recession. In some states enrollment even declined as unemployment skyrocketed.  \n Elizabeth Lower-Basch, a senior policy analyst with the center, said at least Medicaid\u2019s funding caps would be indexed to inflation under the Republican proposal, which she considers disastrous.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s an improvement over the TANF block grant,\u201d she said. \u201cAlmost anything would be.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "The Republican health care bill goes a lot further than just repealing Obamacare.", "title": "Paul Ryan Seems Excited To Kick People Off Medicaid | The Huffington Post"}

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was among the so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2014 House members who have access to the most highly classified information \u2014 who met with Comey Thursday evening. Schiff came away with no information supporting Trump\u2019s claims, he told CNN. \u201cI think when Sean Spicer isn\u2019t even willing to talk about it,  you know there\u2019s a real problem .\u201d \n Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the Republican head of the committee, also said earlier this week that he had seen no evidence backing Trump\u2019s accusation. He said after the Comey meeting that nothing had changed. Comey had earlier said there was no truth to Trump\u2019s claim and had asked the Justice Department, now headed by Trump\u2019s pick Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to  make a statement  to that effect, but the department declined. \n Schiff made his comments the same day as a bizarre standoff between the president and an ABC reporter who repeatedly asked Trump if there was any evidence to back his claims.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  March 4, 2017 \n \n The Associated Press reported Friday that Trump, as the media has speculated over the last week, very likely obtained the information from an  unverified Breibart News article . Aides had placed a copy of the article in his Saturday morning reading material, an unnamed White House official told the news service.\u00a0 \n The article was based on an accusation by conservative radio personality Mark Levin that Obama was waging a shadowy\u00a0\u201c silent coup \u201d against Trump,\u00a0again with no evidence or verification. Levin referenced an article in Heat Street\u00a0 that never mentioned the word \u201cwiretap.\u201d \n Trump\u2019s Twitter language that he had \u201cjust found out\u201d about the wiretapping (apparently from a media outlet, not from his own intelligence services) was similar to his controversial comment on Sweden last month that seemed to indicate that there had been a terrorist attack in the country the previous night. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening in Sweden last night,\u201d he said at a Florida rally. In fact,  what was\u00a0\u201chappening\u201d was that Trump was watching a Fox News  program on refugees in Sweden.

He used dog-whistle language to speak to white people who were angry because they felt ignored; part of the angst concerning immigrants and Muslims is tied into the belief held by many white people that too many people of color are coming into this country and that they are threatening the livelihood of white people. \n They are white nationalists, a phenomenon which is not new and is perhaps more dangerous than is white supremacy. White nationalists feel like America was \u201cbuilt by white people for white people.\u201d The ideal of pluralism notwithstanding,  white nationalists  are probably more comfortable with incoming immigrants if they are white and Christian.\u00a0 \n In 1860, Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis, who would become the first president of the Confederacy, spoke with passion as he argued against the passage of a bill that would have funded education for black people. Davis was incensed, and said, on the floor of the Senate, \u201cThis government was not founded by negroes for negroes but by white men for white men.\u201d He said that the bill assumed that black people were equal to whites, and that, he said, was not the case. \u201cThe inequality of the white and black races was stamped from the beginning.\u201d (Ibram Kendi:  Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of    Racist Ideas in America, p. 3) \n Whites sought to keep power and control in the hands of whites from this country\u2019s inception and are still doing it. The phrase, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d was interpreted by non-white people, but especially by African Americans, as meaning, \u201cMake America white again.\u201d Globalization had done something to upset the  racial  make up of this country, and many white people were alarmed. Pat Buchanan made a prediction that by 2063, America would no longer be a predominantly white country. Even that possibility riled white nationalists. Something had to be done. Something  was  done. A man got into office whose chief strategist is a white nationalist and whose attorney general is known not to be in favor of the influx of immigrants of color into this country. \n The fact that the GOP has control of two of the three branches of the federal government makes it easier for the agenda of the white nationalists to get through. It feels like the White House is not a lot different than a small sheriff\u2019s office in the South, where the sheriff knows a white man has killed a black person, but also knows there will be no justice. The good ol\u2019 boys \u2015 including not only the sheriff, but the judge, the attorneys and the jury \u2015 will put the black man where he belongs: in prison or worse. \n As the administration ignores the fact that Vladimir Putin is easing his way into the very fabric of American democracy, some of us shudder. As we watch the Republican Congress, and far too many Democrats, slide silently into line behind the president, we shudder. The good ol\u2019 boys are closing ranks, and it feels like there is little anyone can do about it. \n When Emmet Till was murdered in 1955, an all-white jury acquitted two white men, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, of the murder, though it was clear to all that they had done it, and they confessed the crime to a magazine after their acquittal. When it seems crystal clear that white police have used excessive force, resulting in the deaths of far too many black people, the good ol\u2019 boys close ranks. They protect each other. All-white juries have historically ignored evidence of white guilt and have put far too many African Americans in prison for life or sentenced them to death, often for crimes they clearly did not commit or for crimes for which whites receive far lesser sentences. \n It\u2019s the good ol\u2019 boys network. \n It is present in the criminal justice system, in the political system and in the economic system. The good ol\u2019 boys have no intention of yielding any of the power they feel was given to them by God at the inception of this country. Many feel that diversity is no less than an attempt to  ethnically cleanse  white people from America.\u00a0 \n It is not going to happen. The good ol\u2019 boys network is deep and wide, and the club members are white nationalists who will do whatever it takes to keep things as they believe things should be. \n We should all hold onto our hats. We are in for the ride of our lives, and America, already pulled from some its ideals, will survive, but will walk with a distinctive limp when this period of history passes. The mark of the good ol\u2019 boys will be made, just as it was during Jim Crow. Rev. William Barber says we are in the Third Reconstruction. \n We are, and it is not quite clear where America will be as a nation when the club members realizes its agenda. \n\n \n Related... \n \n \n Donald Trump Will Not Drain The Swamp.

John Shimkus (R-Ill.) incredulously wondered why the cost of  prenatal care for pregnant women  should be included in the health insurance premiums paid by men.  \n Leaving aside the fact that those pregnancies didn\u2019t occur spontaneously in the absence of males, the problem with this argument is that there are countless medical needs an insurance policyholder will never have, but for which they pay premiums. Not everyone gets high blood pressure, but everyone in the insurance pool chips in for those who do. And, of course, women pay into an insurance system that covers prostate cancer, even though they don\u2019t even have prostates.\u00a0 \n On Thursday, during a wonky press conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was making his own argument about insurance when he described what he called the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cfatal conceit.\u201d The 2010 health care law, Ryan explained, expects that \u201cyoung and healthy people are going to go into the market, and pay for older sicker people, so the young healthy person is going to be made to buy health care, and they\u2019re going to pay for person who gets breast cancer in her 40s, or gets heart disease in his 50s.\u201d \n Next, Ryan pointed to a pie chart, showing the distribution of insurance buyers. The big piece of the pie, representing people in relatively good health, was in blue. The little piece, for those in poor health, was in red.  \n \u201cThe whole idea of Obamacare is that the people in the blue side pay for the people in the red side,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe people who are healthy pay for the people who are sick. It\u2019s not working. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s in a death spiral.\u201d \n From there, Ryan went on to explain how the Republican repeal bill would stop the skyrocketing premiums and collapsing markets, so that Americans can enjoy \u201cuniversal access\u201d to medical care. \n The supposed fatal conceit of the Affordable Care Act is actually a conceit of every successful universal health care system in the world. Everybody pays in, and everybody benefits, because the young eventually get old and the healthy inevitably become sick. Here in the U.S., company insurance plans have long operated by the same basic principle, which is why the employee contribution for a 25-year-old stock clerk at Target is the same as for a 55-year-old cashier.  \n The problem in American health care has always been taking care of the people who can\u2019t get coverage from an employer, because they don\u2019t work for a big company. While Ryan\u2019s comments provoked mockery on social media, there was an element of truth to what he said.  \n Selling to individuals in a way that attracts both the healthy and unhealthy really is tricky, because without some easy mechanism for joining (like having an human resources manager sign you up) or some added financial enticement (like the existing tax break for employer coverage), the healthy ones are less likely to buy.  \n Before the Affordable Care Act came along, insurers didn\u2019t even try. Instead, they simply wouldn\u2019t sell coverage to people who had records of medical problems, and they would avoid covering some conditions likely to incur big costs or attract high risks. This worked out just fine for the insurance companies. It worked out not well at all for the people with pre-existing conditions \u2015 who, by definition, were the ones who needed insurance most of all. \n The Affordable Care Act put a stop to all of that. It guaranteed coverage of pre-existing conditions and required that all plans have comprehensive benefits. To make this viable for insurers, it sought to lure healthy people through a combination of tax credits (which make getting coverage less expensive) and tax penalties (which make not getting coverage more expensive).  \n Although critics like Ryan  never admit  it, the arrangement has generally worked well in Massachusetts, the state that pioneered this approach, and in places like California and Michigan \u2015 where insurers are figuring out how to compete in the new market and consumers are finding coverage that\u2019s priced comparably, or even cheaper, than similar employer policies.  \n In states like Arizona, North Carolina and Tennessee, it\u2019s a different story. Insurers in those places ran up huge losses, because they attracted fewer young and healthy people. In response, they\u2019ve jacked up premiums, and some have abandoned markets altogether.\u00a0GOP policy decisions, like blocking  Medicaid expansion  in some states, made the problem worse. But they weren\u2019t the only factor. \n As experts keep pointing out, the law\u2019s subsidies basically make a true \u201c death spiral \u201d in these states impossible, since they insulate lower-income consumers from price hikes. But people who don\u2019t get assistance take a big hit, and fleeing insurers have already left many counties with just one company. (At least for the moment, a few counties in Tennessee actually have none lined up for next year.) \n The severity and prevalence of the problems  depend  on  who \u00a0you ask, but among nonpartisan experts, the dominant view \u2015 maybe even the consensus \u2015 is that shoring up the system\u2019s weaknesses wouldn\u2019t be difficult.  \n Getting more young and healthy people into the system is mostly a matter of making insurance just a little more financially attractive for them.  \n That can be done through any number of ways \u2015 by padding out the existing subsidies, for example, or creating \u201creinsurance\u201d funds to help carriers with their most expensive consumers. Such adjustments are altogether typical for large programs in their infancy. And finding the money for them wouldn\u2019t be as challenging as usual, given that the Affordable Care Act has actually come in under budget. \n The House Republican bill, of which Ryan is the chief architect, actually includes a few of these elements. And in a less polarized political environment, it\u2019s easy to imagine them forming the basis for a bipartisan compromise.  \n But of course, the Republican bill doesn\u2019t merely tweak. It proposes to junk the existing system altogether, putting in its place a scheme that looks more like the old one, so that insurers could offer skimpier policies and have a little more leeway to keep out people with pre-existing conditions.  \n The bill would give states extra money to help those people, but, as Ryan made clear on Thursday, his preferred solution is special, segregated high-risk pools \u2015 like the ones that some states operated previously. In other words, the goal is to create two different groups of people \u2015 the healthy and the sick, rather than combine them. \u00a0 \n Ryan said what Republicans always do, which is that their plan would improve access. It\u2019s difficult to find a credible expert who takes that seriously \u2015 particularly since, in addition to making regulatory changes, the House bill would redirect the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies. As a result of the shift, people with low incomes would get less assistance.  \n The Congressional Budget Office hasn\u2019t had a chance to issue a formal projection on the Republican plan, but preliminary  estimates  have suggested the number of people who lose coverage will be in the millions, at least.  \n As for those high-risk pools that Ryan champions, they have a  track record \u00a0\u2015 and it is not good. They typically provided limited coverage at high prices, mostly because they never got enough funding. Enrollment was nowhere near the number of people in need of such plans. \u00a0 \n Republicans rarely concede these things, and Ryan didn\u2019t on Thursday. But it\u2019s not clear how much any of this matters to him and other Republicans.\u00a0 \n The ultimate goal for Ryan and his GOP allies isn\u2019t to guarantee access to health care, or financial protection from medical bills. It\u2019s to minimize taxes, especially taxes on the rich, and to let the free market operate with as few regulations as possible. \n That\u2019s a perfectly defensible choice for extreme conservatives like Ryan and Shimkus. But it reflects a very particular set of priorities and values \u2015 and perhaps not one a majority of Americans share. \n CORRECTION: \u00a0An earlier version wrongly identified Rep. John Shimkus\u2019 state. He represents a district in Illinois. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "Yes, healthy people pay sick people's medical bills.

Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) saw more devious motives at work. \n \u201cPresident Obama himself said he was gonna stay in Washington until his daughter graduated. I think we oughta pitch in to let him go somewhere else because he\u2019s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda,\u201d Kelly told a gathering in his home state on Saturday. \n He suggested that the former president was somehow blocking the Republican agenda, even as the GOP controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. \n \u201cPeople sit back and they say to me, \u2018My gosh, why can\u2019t you guys get this done?\u2019 I\u2019m saying we\u2019ve got a new CEO, we\u2019ve got some new heads in the different departments, but the same people are there, and they don\u2019t believe that the new owners or the new managers should be running the ship.\u201d the congressman said. \n Thomas Qualtere, a Kelly spokesman, tried to walk back his boss\u2019s comments on Friday. \n \u201cRep. Kelly delivered his remarks to an audience of fellow Republicans in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, last Saturday. He was sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Qualtere said in a statement. \u201cHe fully supports President Obama\u2019s decision to stay in Washington until his daughter finishes school. He hopes the former president will continue to root for President Trump\u2019s success as he said he would do last November.\u201d \n Obama has extended his successor the courtesy  of not criticizing him ,\u00a0although he denied Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated accusation that he\u2019d ordered a wiretap on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\u00a0An Obama spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n Later on\u00a0 Friday, \u00a0Kelly\u2019s office sent out a second statement to say that he does not believe Obama is personally operating a shadow government. \n \u201cBecause of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly\u2019s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government,\u201d the statement says \u201cHe does believe it would be helpful to the new administration if the former president would personally call for an end to all leaks and obstruction by personnel from his administration who currently serve in the Executive Branch under President Trump.\u201d \n Kelly\u2019s \u201cshadow government\u201d remark echoes the thinking in conservative media that there is a  \u201cdeep state\u201d \u00a0in the federal government working to subvert Trump. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer argued on Friday that government employees were still trying to advance Obama\u2019s goals. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think it should come as any surprise that there are people that burrowed into government during the eight years of the last administration and may have believed in that agenda and want to continue to seek it. I don\u2019t think that should come as a surprise to anyone,\u201d Spicer said. \n The story has been updated with a later statement from Rep.

Thank god for the alternative media, that saves us from the mainstream garbage by showing us the truth.\u201d \n McDaniel, a 28-year-old U.S. citizen living in Costa Rica, told The Independent his website made him about $615, which he  said he planned to donate  to the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. \n \u201cI was startled that in today\u2019s world, so many could be so willfully ignorant,\u201d McDaniel  wrote  on his website. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a frightening time when a group of people screaming, \u201cFAKE NEWS!\u201d at the top of their lungs, live, eat and sleep falsehoods.\u201d \n His previous stories now have a link at the bottom to his confession post. But it\u2019s unlikely that will stop many from still supporting false claims. The top comment at the end of McDaniel\u2019s confession post seems to prove his point.

The state, with its population of 39 million, is large enough to wield significant clout in the market. \n \u201cFor the past 50 years, California has led the country and the world when it comes to clean cars,\u201d Margo Oge, who once directed the Office of Transportation and Air Quality at the Environmental Protection Agency, told\u00a0 The Washington Post . \n But its progressive environmental standards rely on a kind of special dispensation from the federal government. The Clean Air Act gave the EPA authority to grant a waiver of national emissions standards to California if it enacted tougher regulations. Waivers were later granted to other states that adopted California\u2019s standards instead of the less-stringent federal ones. \n California\u2019s cutting-edge rules helped buoy a national agreement by the Obama administration and the automobile industry that calls for cars to achieve an average of\u00a0 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 .\u00a0 \n The state has several other waivers for tougher environmental rules.\u00a0In testimony last month before the Senate Committee on Environmental Quality, Richard Frank, director of the California Environmental Law & Policy Center, called the arrangement an example of \u201c cooperative federalism .\u201d \n But California leaders fear that the administration of President  Donald Trump , who leads a Republican Party that typically champions states\u2019 rights, will move to yank California\u2019s waiver on fuel economy \u2014 even though it\u2019s supposed to be valid until 2025. The auto industry is already pressing for  fuel-efficiency standards  to be eased. Trade groups  sent letters  asking new EPA chief Scott Pruitt to \u00a0 review the fuel economy standards. Pruitt said at his confirmation hearings that he would review the standards \u2014 and California\u2019s waiver. \n California is expected to head straight to court if the Trump administration calls for easing the standards in the state. \n It\u2019s unclear when that clash might happen. The state has placed former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder  on retainer to take on court cases \u00a0California expects to file against the federal government at some point. \n One environmental rule that the administration swiftly dropped was the ban on using lead ammunition and fishing tackle in national parks and wildlife refuges.  Lifting the ban \u00a0was one of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s first actions. \n California  plans to stick to its state ban , passed in 2013, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife told KQED Science. The law phases in a complete prohibition on lead hunting ammo  in the whole state by 2019 .\u00a0 \n Lead bullets left in the environment or in carrion and prey can be ingested by other animals, causing neurological damage and death. Among those most at risk are eagles and the endangered California condor.\u00a0As many as  20 million birds and other animals  die of lead poisoning nationally each year because of the nearly 100,000 tons of lead that sportsmen use, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.\u00a0 \n \n Earlier this month a bald eagle was brought into the Blue Mountain Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Oregon suffering from the telltale loss of body control linked to lead poisoning. \n Despite treatment, the eagle died. \n \n\n \n Related Coverage \n \n \n EPA Chief Scott Pruitt Says Those Who Want To Kill His Agency Are 'Justified' \n \n \n Scott Pruitt Botches John Muir Quote In First Speech As EPA Administrator \n \n \n Scott Pruitt Confirmed As EPA Chief Despite New Firestorm Over Emails \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "The state often on the forefront of protections prepares to stand strong against an environmental retreat.", "title": "California Girds To Battle Feds To Save The Environment | The Huffington Post"}

The president wants authorities to scrap the so-called \u201ccatch and release\u201d of recent border crossers, instead detaining every single person until they can be deported. Leaked memos obtained by MSNBC appear to indicate DHS is considering a plan to increase immigrant detention bed space\u00a0 by nearly 500 percent .  \n Any one of those policies would send DHS\u2019 budget skyrocketing and saddle the department with decades\u2019 worth of long-term costs. But neither the wall nor the personnel increases would do much to raise the overall level of deportations, many experts say \u2015 which means Trump\u2019s plans sound more like expensive wishful thinking than a blueprint for effective enforcement.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s billions and billions and billions of dollars,\u201d John Sandweg, the former acting director of ICE, told The Huffington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent not feasible under the current funding levels.\u201d \n The border wall alone, as proposed, would cost more than $20 billion, according to a DHS estimate. That figure already tops the combined annual budgets of ICE and Customs and Border Protection. Congress would have to fund such a large-ticket item outside the department\u2019s normal budget requests.  \n But Trump\u2019s proposed hiring binge could prove even more expensive. The salaries alone for 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and 10,000 ICE agents would add nearly $1 billion to the DHS annual budget.  \n And salaries are just the most obvious cost, according to Sandweg. Agents with both Border Patrol and ICE go through months of training. The agency\u2019s academies would have to be expanded to accommodate thousands of new recruits. Once in the field, they would also need office space, weapons and vehicles \u2015 all on the government\u2019s dime. \n\n \n \n \nSandy Huffaker via Getty Images\n \n \nThe U.S.-Mexico border wall is shown on July 8, 2012, in Nogales, Arizona. Several hundred miles' worth of barriers already separate the United States and Mexico, but it isn't enough for President Donald Trump.\n \n \n\n\n Federal workers also receive generous benefits, including annual raises and pensions. So the costs of the added personnel would continue to balloon as time goes on. A Politico report from January estimated the additional 10,000 ICE agents would add some  $3.9 billion to DHS\u2019 budget  annually. An undated CBP estimate puts the hiring costs at more than $2 billion over the next two years, a figure that includes hiring only a small portion of the proposed 5,000 agents.  \n \u201cEvery year the cost goes up,\u201d Gil Kerlikowske, the last to head CBP under President Barack Obama, told HuffPost. \u201cHealth care. Retirement. Project that 15 years on. It\u2019s a tremendous cost and one that continues well past retirement.\u201d \n Border Patrol hasn\u2019t even been able to keep the staff it has a budget to pay for. Kerlikowske left office in January   with 1,200 open positions needing to be backfilled. Finding qualified applicants who can pass security screenings and speak Spanish, and who are willing to live in remote border towns and accept salaries lower than those paid to ICE agents, is always a challenge. It\u2019s an even more daunting task when unemployment is low and CBP finds its agents getting poached by other law enforcement agencies after a few years on the job, Kerlikowske said. \n To speed the process along, DHS is considering adopting less stringent guidelines for hiring,  Foreign Policy magazine reported  last month \u2015 a development that has some experts worried, given the agency\u2019s vulnerability to corruption. An undated memo from CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan describes a plan to fill the open positions and hire the extra 5,000 agents over the next five years. But that optimistic timeline would require a 25 percent increase in the number of annual applicants. Making that happen would require still more money for outreach.  \u00a0 \n The memo, posted to the  Border Patrol union\u2019s website , recommends limiting the use of polygraph tests on some applicants, including some former police officers or members of the military, to get agents through the door faster. ICE doesn\u2019t subject applicants to a polygraph test, the memo notes.  \n But relaxing hiring standards like the polygraph exam, the final step in the hiring process, worries some. A 2013\u00a0 story by the Center for Investigative Reporting \u00a0 found that several applicants who\u2019d passed every element of the hiring process went on to fail the polygraph exam because they admitted to committing crimes.  \n Several of these applicants confessed to trafficking drugs. One said he once woke up in a kitchen doused in blood, but couldn\u2019t remember whether he\u2019d committed a crime during the three hours he\u2019d blacked out. Another applicant, Joseph Montross, admitted to owning a large cache of child pornography. Instead of joining Border Patrol, Montross, a former U.S. Marine, was prosecuted and sentenced to 30 years in prison. \n \n It\u2019s billions and billions and billions of dollars. It\u2019s 100 percent not feasible under the current funding levels. \n John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE \n \n\n Even the hiring process itself would cause logistical problems for the department. John Roth, the chairman of the DHS Office of Inspector General,  told Congress last month  that according to a recent audit, the department suffered from a lack of human resources staff and poorly organized systems for tracking and processing job applications. \u201cIn fiscal year 2015, it took an average of 282 days (over 9 months) to hire a Border Patrol Agent, measured from the time the job announcement closed to the date the applicant was hired,\u201d the report says. \n All that spending might seem justified if you\u2019re determined to crack down on unlawful migration. But none of these multibillion-dollar, decades-long commitments are likely to have that effect,\u00a0at least in the short term.  \u00a0 \n Both CBP and ICE are already well-staffed and arrest far more people on a daily basis than they can detain. Without sufficient detention capacity, agents would simply have to release many people they detain after serving them with orders to appear in immigration court.  \n The Trump administration has taken note of the bottleneck. The Department of Justice plans to  send 50 immigration judges to detention centers  across the country to help speed up the deportation process.  But it\u2019s unclear what difference that will make.  \n The immigration courts face a backlog of more than  540,000 cases , with only about 300 judges to hear them. While the National Association of Immigration Judges has pressed for years to double the number of judges handling these cases, they\u2019re currently backfilling 73 open positions.  \n Sending more judges to detention centers wouldn\u2019t automatically make those cases move much faster, according to NAIJ President Dana Leigh Marks. Defendants need time to find lawyers. They need to find people to testify on their behalf. They often need to obtain documents from foreign countries, a process that can take months.  \n \u201cThere is only so fast you can go and be consistent with the due process needs of the individuals in the courtroom,\u201d Marks told HuffPost. \u201cA judge has to balance the interest of the government with the rights of the individual to adequately prepare.\u201d  \n All told, Trump is asking Congress to spend tens of billions of dollars on symbolic action that would likely have a marginal impact at best.  \n Trump may not be able to deport many more people than Obama, but his promised crackdown already appears to have made the enforcement system more erratic.  \n In the first major investigations operation carried out by ICE, roughly a quarter of the people detained  had no criminal records  \u2015 a sharp departure from last year, when all but  8 percent of those deported from the interior  of the country had either committed crimes that landed them among ICE\u2019s enforcement priorities, or had been deported before. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "A giant wall and massive staff increases sound like expensive wishful thinking.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Immigration Crackdown Would Burn Billions Of Dollars DHS Doesn\u2019t Have | The Huffington Post"}

His willingness to find common ground shows why  The Art of the Deal  is not just a distant memory of a previous life.\u201d \n Meadows was joined\u00a0 in the White House meetings \u00a0Thursday by former HFC Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who also noted the receptiveness of the president to strike a deal. \n \u201cWe\u2019re still working on those changes that we think would make this bill consistent,\u201d Jordan told The Huffington Post on Friday, adding that they hadn\u2019t \u201csettled\u201d on any of their negotiations. \n \n [Trump's] willingness to find common ground shows why 'The Art of the Deal' is not just a distant memory of a previous life. \n Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a House Freedom Caucus member \n \n\n But based on conversations with members familiar with the negotiations, in addition to the Medicaid timeline, conservatives also want to allow insurance companies to offer plans that don\u2019t meet the coverage standards of the  Affordable Care Act , which means plans could have higher deductibles or offer gaps in coverages for lower premiums. \n The Republicans legislation already does some of this by repealing the rule mandating that plans cover at least 60% of medical expenses. There is some concern that other provisions on coverage would break the  reconciliation status  of the bill, which means those provisions would take 60 votes in the Senate to pass, but members want to look for ways to increase the number of insurance mandates and rules that could be repealed while still not violating that so-called Byrd rule. \n Freedom Caucus members also want to allow people to use health savings accounts to pay their premiums, instead of just using them for deductibles and other out-of-pocket medical costs. Making that change would introduce an element of a plan by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) to allow tax-free dollars to be used to pay for insurance, which would not quite blow up the entire current GOP bill. \n Finally, members want a 20-hour work requirement for able-bodied adults who are on Medicaid. That would further cut some Medicaid costs, but the idea seems based more on stereotypes than on potential savings. The\u00a0 vast majority  of people on Medicaid are ill, in school, already working or looking for work. \n Freedom Caucus members still haven\u2019t given up on overhauling a linchpin of the bill \u00a0 \u2015 the advance refundable tax credits \u2015 but some members now acknowledge that major changes to the basis of the replacement language would pretty much amount to Republicans starting over, which doesn\u2019t look apt to happen. \n Still, one caucus member noted that if Republicans were willing to negotiate on the tax credits, there would be a universe of items that conservatives could give up in exchange, perhaps even lengthening the term of the Medicaid expansion past the 2020 date. \n If Republicans actually adopted the changes conservatives are advocating for, however, it would instantly present the House with vote problems from moderates \u2015 and even more problems in the Senate. \n Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, told HuffPost on Friday that if Republicans moved up the Medicaid expansion phaseout, it would be a \u201cbig problem,\u201d and he indicated that a strong majority in the House \u2015 probably every Democrat and a number of Republicans \u2015 would oppose that change. \u201cIf there\u2019s that discussion, they should allow an amendment on the floor to resolve the issue.\u201d \n The problem for House leaders is that even if Republicans agreed to the conservative wish list, there still would be Freedom Caucus members voting against the bill. \n HFC member Scott Perry (R-Pa.) noted on Friday that everyone knows there are some conservatives who are going to oppose the bill. \u201cBut I think some members are more flexible,\u201d Perry said, adding that leaders needed to show \u201csome good faith\u201d and make changes that are \u201cmeaningful and impactful.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n My calls are running 30 to 1 to oppose it. \n Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) \n \n\n Among the conservatives who appear unwilling to negotiate are Justin Amash (R-Mich.), who is upset with just about every facet of the bill and the process for the legislation, and his non-HFC buddy Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has taken to calling the legislation \u201ca stinking pile of garbage.\u201d \n \u201cMy calls are running 30 to 1 to oppose it,\u201d Massie said Thursday night. \n Massie went on to ridicule House Speaker  Paul Ryan \u2019s three-pronged approach to \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d which involves passing this reconciliation bill, letting Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price handle some aspects administratively and then passing other bills (with a challenging 60-vote threshold in the Senate) to address health care costs. \n \u201cThere\u2019s three baskets: There\u2019s the repeal-and-replace basket, there\u2019s the Tom Price basket and the Easter basket,\u201d Massie said. \n And there are other hard-line right members who look apt to oppose any bill resembling this plan if it maintained the 2020 date for rolling back Medicaid. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost on Friday that Republicans shouldn\u2019t agree to any Medicaid expansion \u201cwhatsoever,\u201d and Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) suggested he couldn\u2019t support any measure that didn\u2019t address the expansion until after 2018. \n Which is all to say, even if Republicans adopted the other changes conservatives wanted, without the most contentious modification, the Medicaid expansion date, there would still be a group of Republicans who would probably oppose the measure. And if Republicans did change the date of the Medicaid expansion, they would face a mutiny from moderates. \n Conversely, if House GOP leadership continued to refuse to negotiate, they could probably still pick off a number of Freedom Caucus members, who are not united in their opposition to the bill. \n Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) told HuffPost this week that the tax credits were a \u201cpositive step,\u201d and his fellow Freedom Caucus Texan, Joe Barton, already supported the most contentious provisions in the Energy and Commerce Committee. \n Barton actually had an amendment in committee to shorten the time on the expansion, but he withdrew it when Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) asked, though Barton noted Friday he had a \u201cgreen light\u201d to offer it for floor consideration. \n On the one hand, Freedom Caucus members hope their negotiations lead to floor votes on their demands, but on the other hand, they worry House leadership will rally members against their amendments. \n \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody\u2019s thumb on the scale,\u201d Perry said this week. \u201cWe want an honest run at the thing. \n \u201cIf we lose, I guess we\u2019ll have to determine how that factors into our decision. But if we lose an unfair fight, that\u2019s going to be problematic.\u201d \n Jeffrey Young and Jonathan Cohn contributed reporting. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n", "description": "They want a lot.
